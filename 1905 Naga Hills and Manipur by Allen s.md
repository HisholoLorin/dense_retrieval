# Preface.

The Gazetteer of the Nags Hills district should on1 y be regarded as a supplement to the monographs on the various Nags tribes, which are now under preparation by Mr. A. W. Davis, C.S. Similarly, much interesting information, which might under other circumstances have suitably been incorporated in this work, will be published separately in various monogrsphs on the Manipuris and the hill tribes subject to them, which are now engaging the attention of Mr. Hodson. It will be observed that there is no directory appended to thh Gazetteer. Apart from the headquarters stations there are, however, no towns or places of sufficient eke or importance to demand a **sepa~ate** description. I am indebted fo Lieutenant-Colonel Maxwell, C.S.I., for **Bie** kindnes~ in examining the Gazetteer of Manipur, **and to** 
Mr. **Davia** and Mr. Reid for criticking the hetfeer of the **Naga** Hills.

The Bard enters it at **the** south-west corner and **runs** in 8 north-easterly direotion almost up to Kohima AB **far m Be&** there are tbree main mges of **hille** lying **perallel** to one another, the moet northerly of the three **being** the largest and the most important, and containing several **peah** over 6,000 feet in height.

For, thougb there are from ten to twelve mil& ,of hilly **country** between **its** lower slopes and *the flat valley of the Dhansiri, them outer hills are, for the most part, ,only from 1,500 to 8,000 feet in height. Near Kohima the Bard ie merged in the mountain rangee which have been prolonged through **Mmipur** from the Yams of hkas, **ead** the main range seernee a **much** more norther1 y direction. **This range** is coneiderably higher th.n the **Bard** Overhanging- Mao Thana, on the southsra frontier of the district, them ie a momtoin whoee summit ie 9,808 feet above the level of the **eea,** and a few **milee** further north stands Japvo (9,890 feet),

height, but at Munching it riees to **41,284** feet. An outer range rune pdel to it on the west, which has a general hei3ht of between 1,500 or 2,600 feet, md s third mge **Lies** between **the** two northern seations of these chaine of hills. The Jepvo range throws out numerous spurs towards the east and west, **and** the ssme phenomenon is to be observed in the hills which trsveree the Mokokchung subdivision north of the Doimg. The general north-emstern tendency is still discernible, but the **country,** as a whole, consists of a tumbled mass of hills, most of which **are** between three and four thousend feet in height. 

In their natural etate these hills are covered with mag- **peeranor** 
dense evergreen forest. Most of the eaeier slopes, up to a oP **~LW.** 
height of about 6,000 feet, have, however, at one time or another, been cleared for cultivation. Where this has been done they are covered for the most part with scrub, bamboo, and grass, and the larger forest trees have disappeared. In the country inhabited by the Angamia the hill sidee **have** been cut out into terraced rice fields and there is comparatively little jungleeta be seen. 

Nowhero, in fect, is there ~nuch timber still remaining except in the bottom of the **rivcr** valleys and on the summits of the hills. **Thc** slopes of Jrtpvo are covered with primeval forest, huge trees tower into the air, and there is comparatively little undergrowth beneath their over-shadowing limbs. Near tho summit, . the forest is almoet entirely composed of rhododendrons, whoso trunks and boughs are buried in thick moss and lichen. The actual peak ie a mass of tumbled rocks, which, towards the south, fall away in a sheer precipice over a thonesnd feet in depth. Some of the higher **hille** 
near Japvo have steep **grasey** slopee, atudded with rooka and boulders, and me almost entirely destitute of tree growth; a characteristic which is still more strongly marked in the portion of the range that lies beyond the frontier of Manipur. In the neighbourhood of Kohima the valleys are broad, tho slopes of the hills are fairly easy, and have, to a, great extent, been brought under cultivation, and the scenery is, for a hill district, unusually tame. The lower hills are not so healthy **and** ere in consequence but sparsely peopled. The outer ranges on the north are for the moat part covered with heavy jungle, end the intervening valleys afford aehome for elephants and other varieties of big game. 

Birsr e~tam. The Barail and the Japvo range of mountains form the watershed of the district, and, as they are seldom more than t8n or fifteen miles from the weetern boundary, none of the rivers that come tumbling down their elopes have time to attain to any considerable dimeneiona before they enter Sibsagar or Nowgong. 

Almost aa far north ss Mokokohung, the whole of the dreinage of the north-western face of the hills ultimately finds its way into the Dhansiri, The Dhansiri itself 'risee in the south-west corner of the Naga Hills, below thb Laiahisng peak, **sad** flows s north-westerly course for about fifteen miles. It then turns st right angles to the north-east, and as far as Dimapur forms the northern boundary of the district. Aa it flowr, along a few miles from the outer range of hills it reoeives s lerge number of tributaries. But, with the exception of the Diphupsni, they are **all** of them small md unimportsnh md **era** the **Diphnpmi** is bsvely thirty milm in length. 

The next river worthy of mention is the bngmapani which falls into the Doiang ; but the Zubza, ag the Rengmepni is **ded** when flowing through the hills, is, dter **all,** a very inconsiderable stream. The only river of any **importsnce** in the district is the Doiang. It rises neaz Mao-Thana, and flowe a north-north-easterly course for five and forty miles, when it suddenly turne to the northwest, and pierces the main chain of hills. After flowing for twelve milw in this direction it **again** turne at right anglee and flows for twenty miles to the southweet. Here it turns sharp **again** to the north-west, **end,** 
~hortly after emerging from the hills, it is joined by **its** lergeet tributary, the Rengmapani. The Doiang receives all the drainage of the main mge between the Rengmapani and Wokha, whilo its tributary the Bagti, a etream about twenty-five milee in length, drains the valley between the inner and outer range of hills between Bhandari and **Sonigao.** The Doiang is only navigable for a few miles within the hille, as the channel ie blocked with rocks at **N nbha.** If these were blasted, canoes could pmbably go as far ae the Mokokchung **Wokha** road. 

North of the Doiang, the principal etrwms are the Diaai end the Jhanei, which ultimately fall **into** the Bnhmaputra, after flowmg through the Sibsagar district. The northern frontier of the **Naga** Hills **ie m~rM** 
by the Dikho, which is nevigeble for s short distance within the hills, though the head hunting prcmlivitiea of the tribes living on the further bank might render the voysge rather a risky undertaking. The principal river h the **temifoy** which has recently been annexed is the Tbu, with its tributary the Lanier, which falls into the Chindh. With the exception of the Doiang all of these rivers are mere mountain streams, which make their **way** towards the plains by fairly easy gradients. There am no waterfalls of any importance on **any** of these rivers, and there are no lakes or *jl~ils* within the boundaries of the district. 

ckolom. Generally speaking the Naga Hills are eaid to be mmpoeed of pretertiary rocks overlaid by tertiary strata. Oldham in 1883 deecribed the hille, for about 20 miles north of **Mao** ad 'east of Kohima, as axial, while to the weat of Kobime lay a tract of tertiary country, with dun or gravel deposits immediately to the muth and east of Nichuguard.* The hillsides are formed of a treacherous grey shale, which is very hble to slip after heevy rain, and which forms a stiff hard clay when cut out into the terraces on which rice i8 grown. There are deposits of limestone rock imbedded in the shale, ranging in colour from a, light **gray to** a deep blue, whioh make an excellent building stone. A certain quantity of tufa lime haa receotly been discovered in the veIley of the -8ijju ewt of Kohima, and there are strings and nests of lignite in the hills near Nichupmd. Cod is **also** found in the hills through which the Diaei debouches on the pleine, and near the village of Anakey in the' Mokokchung subdivision. But the most importsnt cod fields in the Naga Hills lie outside the bordere of the district, and have in coneequenw

been described in the Gazetteers of Sibeager and Lrtkhimpur. 

During the winter time the climate of the higher **~~~1,~~** 
hills is cold and bracing. The days are generdly b~ght and sunny, but frost at night is by no means uncommon. At the hottest season of the year the thermometer seldom rises above 80" Fahrenheit in a well-built bungalow at Kohima, but, ae the air is surcharged with mois. 

ture, the climate is sometimes found a little enervating. 

The low ranges of bills that adjoin the plains are far from healthy, and **Nagas** who settle there suffer much from fever, and generally ditijtiorata in physique. The average iainfall at Icohima is only **76+** inches in the year. It is considerably lower than that recorded further east, Wokha returning over, and Mokokchung nearly, one hundred inches. Kohima is, however, aheltered to some extent by the high range of Japvo. 

Nearly four-fifths of the total rainfall at Kohima is precipitated during the four months June to Septernher, and the fall in April and May iu unue~?ally low for Assam. The monthly rainfall at Kohima, Wokha, and Mokokchung will he found in Table I. Strong winds blow from the north-west in February and March, but destructive gales or tornsdoee are not common. 

There is very little game in the Angami moountq, ., 
but wild animale aro still to be found in the hot unhe Jthy valleys, lying between the outer rangea of hills. The list includes elephants, bison (bw **g-),** 
buffdo, tigem, leopar*, beam, the -bur (cerw unicolor) and the barking deer *(ce~~il~8* mntj~c). **The** 
eemw ie ocwionally found on the higher mountaine, and fhe flying lemur **(galeopithecus** *vola~ts* ) i~ s~metime~ met with in the woode. Game birds include wild fowl 
(g@lw **fq'ww),** p&tridgee, .pheasants, including the horned variety *(hqopan* blythii), and woodcook. The wood duck *(marcorizu* eentutatus) is dso occasiondly wen. Elephante are fairly common in the western part of the diefrict, and in 1908-04, 18 animals mere captured by a gentleman who had- been allowed to hunt this bact. A mall herd also makes its home in as elevated valley near the village of Khonoma. The scarcity of gazpe L illuetrsted by the fact that in 1908 only one person wae killed by a wild animal in the Naga Hills, and rewsrds were only psid for the destruction of 4 tigem, 14 leoparde, and 1 bear.

BBOADLY speaking, bhe history of our relationions with **~-wT.** 
the Nagas many be divided into the following feu: 
periods-the period. of control from without, by a, system of expeditions or promenades ; the period of control from within ; the period of absolute non-interference ; 
and the second period of control from within, merging into' gradu~l absorption **into** British territory: It should first be premised **that** for the annexation of their territory the Nagaa are themselves responsible. The oost of the administration of the district is out of all proportion to the revenue thst is obtained, and we only occupied the hills after a bitter experience extending over many yesre, **whbh** clearly 8howed ht annexation a pas the only why of preventiqg raids upon our villsgee. Had the Bngami **Nagas** consented to respect our frontiers, they might have remained as independent as the tribes inhabiting the hills to the'south of Sibsagsr and Lakhimpur; but it was impossible for any civilized power to acquiesce in the perpetual harrying of ite border folk. 

The first period of the history of our relatione with the Nagas dates from 1889 to 1846. During thh time Government attempted to control. the tribes by sending expeditions info the hills ; but the desired result was not obtained, and raids continued to be made into British territory. From 1847 to 1850, the experiment was tried of establishing outposts in the Naga Rille. Samaguting was the first place selected, and later on Lieutenant Vincent held a stockade at Mozema, and, for a, short time, at Khonoma itself. In 1861, Government withdrew from the hills, and for the next ten years the policy of non-interference waa given a fair trial, with resulk that were very much the reverse of satisfactory. In 1866, the post at Samsgnt,ing was re-established, and in 1878, the Deputy Commissioner took up- his quartere in the heart of the Angami Naga country at Kohimcs. Mr. Darnant was the last Deputy Commissioner to come to a violent end, and, sinco his death in 1879, the hietory ~f the &trict has been the history of the gradual extonsion and consolidation of our rule. 

Oaptrin Jenkins The history of what i~ now tho diatrict of the Fj!e'the Naga Hills down to the year 1882 is told in the Northm.Ba %urn. Eaut Frontier of Bengal, by Mr. (afterwards Sir Alexander) Mackenzie, and need **nnly** be briefly aummarised below. The Amgami country was first entered by a European in 1882, when Captain Jenkins and . Captain Pemberbn marched from Manipur, via Popolongmai and Samaguting, to Mohandiju on the Jamuna river. 

They were accompanied by an escort of 700 Manipuri sepoys, and during the whole of their march met with continuous and stubborn opposition. In the folloTg year Gambhir Singh, Raja of Manipur, accompanied by Lieutenant Gordon, marched through the hills by a, mute a little to the east of the one followed by his two predecessor~. The Nagas were at this time in,the hsbit of raiding upon our villages in North Cachar, and the Raja of Manipur and Tula Pdm Senapati,* were called upon to keep them under proper control, a request with which neither of them were in any way able to comply. This requisition was accordingly withdrawn in 1887, and it wrss deoided to bring some pressure to bear upon the Naga tribes, through the intervention of a British officer, Jn January 1889, Mr. Grange, Sub-Assistant to the mot two ex eationr Commiesioner sttNowgong, wad deputed to lead the first **gkie2** 
1888 **and** expedition into the Angami country. Hia transport **1840.** 
arrangements were, howover, so inadequate, that he found himself powerless to take any definite action, and his expedition degenerated into a solnewhat hurried mmch through a part only of the Nags, Bills. Twelve months later Mr. &ange led a second expedition into the hille. He marched vi& Semaguting and Khonoma to Tokquama village, two 'marches further on towards -- -- --- -

Manipor. He met with a good **deal** of oppition, **whioh** 
he succeeded in overcomillg by vigorous and at the me time wdtious action, and in the course of his operations burnt down five villages which opposed him and **took** 
eleven prisoners.. The effects of these strong measures seems to have been satisfactory, and there were no Naga raids in 1840. 

Third **and** Fourth ex- 
Between November 1840, and January 1812, Lieutenant Bigge, the successor of Mr. Grange, conducted tenant si..~. two expeditions into Naga land, in the course of **whioh** he met with fairly friendly treatment from the hill men. During the second of thesc excursions a boundary lime wes **laid** down between Manipur md the Bngami **Nage** 
territory. 

Fifth rxpedltion un. In 1%8 no British officer entered the hills, but the der Oa ujnEgin Nqse were more enterprising and raided the plains and 1644. killed four persons. In the following year they marched into the **Rengme** Bills and killed nine people, **and** murdered three of our Shan eepoys in the North Cachar Hilla. To avenqe this outrage, Captain Eld entered the hills in December 1844, and burnt several of the guilty villages, including a part of tho powerful viUage of Khonomn.

did not discontinue their depredations on the plins. 

In 1846.47, another expedition was sent **into** the hills, and it **was** decided to see whether the' mtablishment of an outpoet amongst the Naga VUSM might not deter these pertinacious savages from raiding on the plains. Samaguting was the plaoe selechd, **and** 
the post was entrusted to Bhogchand Daroga, a resolute and determined man, who had attracted the attention of the Administration by the courageous way in which he had extricated his small escort of the sepoye, when attacked by a greatly superior force of the Nap. Unfortunately, Bhogchand had the faults which are often found in resolute and courageous men, afld endeavoured to press on too far and fast. In 1849, he visited Mozema, to.enquire into a dispute which was in progFess between Nilhcli and Jubili, two leading men in that village. Bhogchand, though only attended by a small and far from reliable escort, had, as Sir Alexander Mackenzie **saye, a** 
firm belief in the prestige of a British conshble, and conducted the whole of his proceedings exactly as he would have done in the case of a riot in the plains. One of Jubili's followers had been murdered by Nilho]i'A men, and Bhogchand proceeded to arrest the culprits. 

He then, in a spirit of severe impartiality, seized seven Kacharis ~110 belonged to Jubili's party, and pmceeded to remove hie prisoners to Samanguting. Conduct of this kind was not calculated to please either sidq **and,** though for a time it had the effect of putting an eild to the feud with which the village had been torn, the result **mas** hardly **what** llad been mtended or anticipated by &OF- A 
chand. The **two** disputing chiefs combined to attack their mutoll enemy st Prephemah.* His guard **wrs** 
@tg of disgraceful cowardice, and Bhogchand and thirteen of the sepoys and coolies were killed. 

dltion I%, b+sTl= 
It wae impossible to overlook or condone the murder 
- of our local representative, and in December 1849, an exoent. **1848.** pedithn was despatched under Lieutenant ~inient to avenge the Darogs's dgath. The troops ompied Mozema, and Nilholi and his clan retired further bwk into the hills. But, while Lieutenant Campbell, who was in charge of the detachment, was vi~iting tho neighlouring village of Jotsoma, the enemy burnt down Moz~ma and destroyed his storea. The expedition had accordingly fo return, but in March **1860,** Lieutenant Vincent reentered the hills and took up his quarters at Mozema, where: he remained durlng the raine. He burnt the village of Jakhsma, and estttblished an outpost of fortysix men at Khonoma ; but, cbs two eepoye were killed close by the stockade, he decided in August to concentrate hie whole force at Mozema, after burning down a portion of the Khonoma village. So little reliance could be pld upon the **Nagas** near Khonoma that he found it necessary to prohibit the sepoys from' leaving the stockade even to draw water, except in parties of twenty men under a non-commissioned officer with at Ieaet ten muekets.

384 men of all arms, equipped with two three-pounder gune and two four-inch mortars, waa despatched against the fort 'at Khonoma. $0 strong, however, were the defences that, though the guns were finally brought within 75 yards, they did no appreciable damage, and an attempt to escalade the fort was foiled by a deep beinch. The force accordingly bivouacked before the village for the night, and in the morning found that the place had been abandoned. The troops then made a demonstration through the hills, and several villages which opposed their progress or declined to furnish them with supplies were burnt. One villago, Kek~a,, sent in two heralds to our camp and solemnly challenged us to a trial of strength, The Mrtnipuris, so they said, were afraid **to'** meet them, and they doubted whether the British were of a different temper. It would have been fatal to our slowly-developing prestige to decline this challenge, and a move wasaccordingly made against the.village. Kekrima was said to contain 1,000 houeea and was proportionately dreaded, but the British force consisted-of 160 sepogs with two three-poundere and a mortar, and about 800 friendly **Nagaa** armed with apertrs. Tho downfall of the challengers **waa** complete. They left at least 100 warriors dead upon the field, while our loss in killed was only two Nagas and one camp-follower. 

The troops were then withdrawn from *he hills, and po~in0f non-interit wae determined for the future to abstain from **all** rention. 

interference with the Nagas. **The** policy that it wae derided to pursue was laid down in e minute by the GCovernor-General, the purport of which is summarieed in the following paragmph : wHereafter,?' wrote bd Dalhouaie, "we ahould confine ourselves to our ofn ground; protect it as it can **and** munt be protected ; At meddle in the feuds or fights of these 'savages ; encourqe trade with them as long they are peaceful towards us ; and rigidly exclude them from all, communication either to sell what they hava got, or to buy what they want if thq ehould become turbulent or troublesome." 
It **waa,** however, one thing to say that we would have no dealings with the Nagas, another to prevent the Nagas from having any dealings with our people. The protection of that long line of jungle-covered frontier proved to be impossible. In 1861, after the policy of nonintervention had been definitely adopted, no less than 22 Nags occurred, in which 66 persons were killed, 10 wounded; and **113** taken captive. It is true that only three of these raids were posiCJively tracad to Angemis, but most of them were committed in North Cacher, and there were eerions grounds for suspecting this particular section of the Naga tribes-
The plicy of non-interferenca waa given a fair trial, but it, was impossible to resist the conclusioll that it wae uneucce~sf~l. The local officere were repeatedly **urging** upon Government the necessity of taking a more vigorousline, **and.** in 1863, the Commissioner of Assam brought the matter prominently before the Lieutenant-Governor. It was not creditable, he eaid, to our Government that euch atrocibieu should recur annually with untarying certainty, and that we should bo powerless aliko to protcot our **eubjeota** or to punish the aggreeeors. It WM 
qaite mrtain thbt, our relatione with the **Nape** could not be on a worae footing. The non-interfereno8 policy **waa** 
exaenent in theory, bnt Government would probabiy be inolined to think that it must be abandoned. 

Sir Ceoil Beadon concurred generally in these views, and directed that an officer stationed at Nowgong should EZgL%. 

ferenoe, iP 
be plsced in immediate communication with the Nagas, **186s.** 
that the chiefs on the border sbould be informed that Government held them responsible for the good conduct or' their villagee, and that annual stipends would be paid to them for thie police duty, as long as they performed it wall. In practice, however, little effect seems to have been given to these orders, and further raide in March and April 1866 again brought the Naga question into notice. The Lieutenant-Governor declined to fall **back** before theee wild tribes, and to recode from their neighbourhood, whenever they happened to annoy us. 

Thia propod had been maae by officers in charge of the North Cauhar **Hfi,** in despair of ever being able to prohot their frontier without the more vigorous action, from whioh, under the orders of Government, they mere debarred. Sir Cd Beadon pointed out that, were tbis policy geuerally edopted, **Asmm** would aoon be divided amongst the Bhutiee, **Abore,** Nagae, Garos, Mishmis and other wild tribes with whioh it **waa** surrounded, and which would quiokly take adventage of any signs of weakness in tho **oentral** Government. 

Oolonel Hopkineon, the Commiaeioner, proceeded to review the exieting position with regard to North Cacher and the **Nagae, and** hie oyiniona are thue summarised by 0ir A **lexsnder Meok entie** :- 
8 Col.Ho kfn. " He **WES** not himself averse from **hkhg** e more **direot** 
mm'mDOqiw control of the country. He, however, pointed out that the democr;ttic nature of the tribal arrangements among the Angamis, the infinite divisions and dieputes existing even in e single village, rendered it impossible to hope for success fr~m the policy of conciliation ab **eittru** proposed by the Government. 

He admitted that no system of frontier military defence, that could be devised would secure perfect immunnity from raids. 

A country void of roads, void of supplies,-a country of interminable hills, of vast swamps covered with dense forest, save where here and there s speck in the ocean of wilderness reveels a misertible Mikir or Kacheri clearance, could **net,** ~ossibly be defended at every point against ib foe for whom hill end swrimp and forest nre resources rather than obstacles. From 1864 to 1865, there had been nineteen Angami raids, in which 232 Britieh snhjects had been killed, wounded, or carried off. Ninetytwo of these unfortunates had been eo lost during the three years **(1854-56),** when a chain of outposte was in existence from Barpathar to Assaloo, conneoted by roads which were regularly patrolled. At most we should be able to keep the raids of euch savages below a certain maximum, and prevent their extension to settled districts.' The eettlement of a trade blockade, the Commissioner maintained, was advantageoue when it could be made practically oomplete, and so far as it was complete.; but none of these sohemee wonld secure the peace of the frontier. Thoy had all been tried and found wanting. If Government were prepared to ooneider a more advanced ~olicy hewas ready to ghow how it could best be carried out. He would depute a specially-qualified officer to proceed .with a force of not low than 200 men, a~d effect a permanent lodgment in the country at a point most convenient for keeping open commnnication0 end procuring suppliee. Thie offioer wonld then invita the 
&iefe to submit themselves to us. Thoee who agreed wonld, as a token of submission, pay an annnel tribute, and in return receive our aid end protection ; while those who **refneed** would be told that we would leave them to th'emcrelvea long ea .they kept the pewe **+war&** ue end thoee who submitted themselves to us."

The Government of India than eanctioned the eetabrhod at a,-, lishment of a strong poet under Lieutenant **Orepry** at ti- in ]me. Samaguting. He waa allowed a force of 160 polioe, *~ll* hill-men and well-armed, and waa informed that hi8 principal duty wm the protection of the plains from the inoursions of the **Nagas.** A good deal waa of necessity left to his discretion, but he was ordered not to exert himself to extend our rule **into** the interior. In January 1866, the Nagas of Razepems cut up a Mikir village in North Cachar. In March, Lieutenant Grego **1.y** visited Razepema and burnt it, but three months later the hillmen retaliazted by killing twenty-ix Mikirs in the village of Sergatncha. In the following cold weather Lieutenant Gregory visited Razepema, burnt the village, prohibited the people from re-occupying their old lands and fields, and distributed Clem amongst other communitiee. 

The establishment of .an officer in the Naga Hills ~0und.m~ 
between had, for a time, the effect of stopping raids upon British **%";P;E~** 
Ne n Hills territory, but trouble wae now experienced from the side of 1 ~i d down in **1871.** 
Manipur. The area of hill country over which this State had any right to exercise jurisdiction was vague and illdefined, and this resulted in friction with the larger and more powerful villagee. The boundary line between Manipur and the Naga Hills diatrict was accordingly bid down in **1872.** The earlier line of 1842 was maintained in all essential points wherever it coiild be identified..

The Nags Hills district was advanced to march with the boundary of Manipur es thus determined.' 
C. **t. But- 1~8.** -,- Captain Gregory was succeeded by Captain Butler nirtration mdaeata in 1869, and the latter officer, who wm by character in **1878.** and disposition admirably qualified for the appointment which he held, proceeded to gradually extend-our control over the hill tribes. Survey parties under e proper escort were sent into the hills, and, when at Wokha in Jenuary 1876, a cooly was murdered and the camp attacked, the retribution taken wa,s sharp and sudden. Butler's operations were, however, brought to a close before the end of the seaeon, as he was ordered to proceed to avenge Lieutenent Rolcombe and eighty of his men, who were treacherously attacked and killed in February by tm-
Dikho Nagas. l Previous to this, the first steps for the fo-1 snnexation of the Nags Hills had been taken by aspbin Johnstone, who, in 1874, **wae** officiating for Csptsin Butler. He definite] J **took** three villages under **his** probction, **and** in **token** of their subrniesion they agreed to pay revenue to Government. The example once set wee soon followed by others. In the winter of 1876, eurvey operatione were re-oommenced, but in December **Captain** Butler reoeived a mortal wound in an ambuscade at Pangti **ncu** 
Wokha. Lieutnant Woodthorpe promptly burnt Pangti, and the neighbouring villages remaining friendly, the work of the survey was carried to completion. 

In August 1876, thechief Commissioner again invited h..otive pollop deolthe attention of the Government of India to the con- gc&ehp death tinual aggressions-of the Angamis, and more especially **1677.** 
of the men of Khonoma and Mozema, upon Naga communities living under Manipur, and to the state of perpetual warfare which prevailed amongst the tribes. During the two preceding years, six villages had been plundered and 384 persons killed, chiefly by Khonoma and Mozema. The Supreme Government s&reed that steps must now be taken to repress these outrages. While the matter was under consideration, Moaema raided the village of Gumaignju near Bealu in the North Cachar Hills, and killed six British eubjeota. In December 1877, tb' Political Officer, Mr. 

Cernegy, accompanied by eo force of 246 sepoys and police, kptured Moaema and burnt the village, but the Nag- still continued to occupy the surrounding hills and harass the British troops. During the courso of these operations, Mr. Carnegy wcbe accidentally shot by hie own sentry, and the submiseion of Mozema **wae** 
finally reooived by Captain Williamson, the Inspector- General of Poliae. 

In 1877, the Secretary of State aaeented to the wn **.tiom** 
of **XOL, pmpoeel that-** the headquarters etation should be moved **lW8-** 
info **eome** ldity in the interior of the hius, and that the distriot **staff** should be etrengthened, so 8e fo admit of the more efficient management of the tribea. In November **1878,** gohima was oocupied without opposition, and by this time sixteen Naga villages **hlrd** tendered their submission. 

Yr. **Dun-** 
.1lt'8 m- The attitude of the tribes during that cold seaeon 
'rwln'. wa~ most encouraging, but in June 1879, there were signs of tronble brewing in the powerful village of Khonoma. The clouds, however, seemed to pass away, the villagers paid up a fine that was imposed upon them in July, and Mr. Damant proposed to make a tour in the Ao country during the following cold weather. Before starting, he decided to. visit Khonoma, and, on October lAth, he set out with an escort of 21 sepoys and 66 police. It is said that an interpreter from Jotsoma warned him that the village **wall** hostile, and on more than one occasion fell on his knees before him and 'begged him not to proceed. Mr. Damant declined to believe that there was any danger. Leaving half of his escort with the baggage at the foot of the hill, he advanced with the remainder up the steep pathway leading to the village. The gate waa closed, and ae he stood before it he was shot dead, and a volley was poured into his escort, **who** broke and fld. The Bag- then pourod out of the village and down the hill, and. completely dispersed the troops, killing 86 and wounding 19.

The news was carried the a same day to Kohima, and messenger was quickly sent to Wokha .to call in the detachment stationed there under **Mr.** 
Hinde. On October 21et, Kohima was besieged, but the **troublee** of the garrison did not lmt for long, ae on the 27th, Colonel Johnstone marched in, un~pposed, with s strong force of Manipuris. 

Within the short space of five years three British ~~~~,,,,

Oficers had been murdered by the hill-men, and it was obviously time that the Nagas should be taught a lesson. A force consisting of the 4Wh Sylhet Light Infantry (the present 8th Gurkha ~ifles), s, detachment of the 43rd Assam Light Infantry (the present 7th Gurkha Rifles) and two mountain gms was sent into the hills. Khonoma was assaulted on the 22nd November. In the attack we lost two British Officers-Major Cock, the **D.A.A.G.,** and Lieutenant Forbes ; and the Subadar Major of the-44th Native Infantry killed, two British and two Native Officers wounded, and 44 of the rank and 1 file killed **rtr~d** wounded. During the night the village was abandoned, and the Nagas retreated to a, strongly fortified position on the crest of the Barail range, where, as they mere excluded from their fields and villages, it was decided to reduce thcm by a blockade. Of the thirtee~ villages hostile to us, Piphima, Merrima, Sacbima, Sephama, and Pachama mere attacked and doatroyed befcre the troops advanced against Khonoma, Lieutenant Maxwell being severely wounded before Sephama. The troop^ moved about the hills and punished the villages that had opposed us, but the Kllonoma men still continued to hold out. 

Towards the end of January, they perpetrated a noia on Ba1adb.n raid of unustial daring **eud** atrocity. A **srden** in party of the 8 **sohor.** 
beleaguered **Nagad** succeeded in making their way fmni the crest of the hill on which they had taken 11p thoir position, and marched to Baladhan, a tea-garden in Cwhar, fully 80 miles distant as the **crow** flies from Khonoma. They attacked the factory at night, killed the **mansger,** Mr. B!yth, and sixteen of the cooliee, and burnt down everything in the place. They then returned Tith such plunder as they could **obtain** to their original po&tion. 

Bobdamion - 
ai **manom,** In March, the Khonoma men at last submitted, bgt md pmitloatlon oi they we= ordered to vacate their village site, and their dietrid. terraced fielde were confiscated. The latter part of the order waa subsequently withdrawu, as it was found imposeible to induce tbem to take up land elsewhere; and no other. Nagas ventured to occupy the confiscated fields from fear of possible reprisals. The rillagers were assessed to revenue, which was at first imposed at the rate of one rupee, and oue maund of rice per houee. 

Subseqwntly it **waa** altered to two rupees per house, the rate usually paid at that time by other hill tribes in hm; and the process of pacification and the exten~ion uf our rule was steadily continued. For aome time, however, small punitive expediticne **weto** a regular feature of the administration of the dietriot, ae it was only by this means that independent Nagas **oould** 
bo taught that the lives and property of those who bad submitted to na mut be respected. None of these expeditions met with any serioue oppoaition, and there aaa no repetition of the painful incidents of the seventies. 

of In May **1888,** the Semaa of Ratami murdered two Lhotse **who** weru British subjects, and declined to obey the order of the Deputy Commiesioner diroating them to oome in md **-ewer** to the oharge. A strong force **wer** 
led the by Mr. **MoCebe.** Be the vlllagere oppoaed the advance of the troops, it **wae neoeesav** to open fim, and Gome 60 or 60 of the enemy were killed. 

The punishment of Ratami had a most excellent effect, and two other villages that had committed murder0 paid up the fines imposed without demur. 

In 1886, Mr. McCabe made a promenade through the aid end pnniehment of Mo~ung- 
Ao country and met with no serious oppositiop, and in 1889 **iami in isee.** 
this territory was incorporated within the boundaries of the district. In April 18.88, Mr. McCabe crossed the Di kho with a small force of military police, to punish the four villages Yajim, Chihn, Nokaen, **and** 
Litsm, who were guilty of raiding on the western or British side of the Dikho. The four villages were burned, and, though some resistance was offered, it was bruehed aside without much difficulty. The hlozung tribe of Nagas, to which these villages belonged, **were** 
not, however, the men to acquiesce in punishment of this kind, without attempting reprisals. They found themselves unable to offer any effective oppasition to olir troops, but in June 1888, they auddenly attacked the two Ao villages of Mougsemdi and Lungkung, and killed 148 persons in the former and 40 in the latter. Steps were immediately taken to protect our territary from repetition of these outragee, and a guard of 50 men was posted in a strong stockadeat Moogsomdi. Tho stockado was attacked ehortly sfterwtards at night by a body of Mozuug **Nagae,** but they were beaten off without difficulty. In January 1889, the Deputy Commissioner led n force of 200 men acroes the Dikho to punish the offenders. **Feeling** that the tmope were too etrong to be oppmed, they offered little reeiebnoe, and bunt five 4 of their villagea, in the hope ~pparently that this would eerve to check our advance. Altogether ten villagea, including Mozungjruni, were destmyecl, with a considerable quantity of grain ; but only five or six of the enemy were killed, and the expedition f~iled to recover some captivss who were said to have been carried off from the Ao villages. On his return from Mooaungjami, the Deputy Commissioner wae again compelled to recrose the Dikho, to punish '~an~sa and two *khsls* of Yangis, who had been ouilty of murdering Nagas who mere to dl intents and b purposes the-subjccts of the Crown. It **was** found impossible to procure the surrender of the actual ~ffendere, aud the houses of the guilty communities were therefore burnt. 

Tb.e Nagas dntake **iun-** In 1892, the village of Yampong **was** burnt, under ticre for iim-**iaty. and** circumstances which clearly show how proDe the savage Ysmpong ie bumtin is to mistake clemency for weakness. A native of 8 **iaea.** ~- - village called Sangtarn killed an Ao who had crossed the DiE-ho on a trading expedition, and then fled to **Yarnpong.** The Deputy Commissioner proceeded to Yampong and demanded the surrender of the murderer; but the villagers declared that they were unable to comply with hie request as tire **man** had **icd** once more and they were ignorant of his whereabouts. The Deputy Cornmiseioner then burnt the murderer's houuo, and ordered the people of Yampong not to harbour him in futum ; 
but as they wore not in an,y **way** rosponsihle for the murder did not inflict any punishment upon them. Fear was the only motive to which the Nagas could ascribe such leniency, and Ysmpong at once proceeded to attack **the villagorn** that had furnished the expedition rrith supplies. The Deputy Commissioner **was** accordingly compelled to return; the people of Yampong opposed his advance, md then evacuated the village, and, aa they declined to come in and surrender or pay a fine, there was nothing for it but to fire the houses. Shortly afterwards the villagers tendered their submission, and thus afforded another instance of the good effect exercised on the **Naga** mind by the burning of his home. As ft~r as that part of the country was concerned, it **wm.** the Deputy Commissioner said, an undoubted fact that burning a village led almost immediately to **the** establishment of good relations with the inhabitants. Strangely enough, after they had been bnrnt out, the people seemed to consider that they had become the children of the Maharani. 

Since that date it has only been neceseary to doe- **one** 
patch one regular punitive expedition, though the Deputy :'P edition n he put thirteen Commissioner, when touring in what was known as the **yebra.** 
area of political control, was generally accompanied by n guard; and **from** time to time it was found necesssry to punish villages who declined to surrender the actual persons guilty of a murder. In November 1903, **the** 
Pelasi *khl* of Milozengjami killed two Aos who had gone 
:\cross tllo Diklio b trade, and in the following month the Chongpu *lchcl* carried off three mithun from British kmitory. It was impossible to obtain reparetion for these outrageo, and in January 1906, the lhpilty Commissioner proceeded to the village with a force of **100** 
men of the military police. The inhabitante abandoned their I~omes, amd killed two of the tran~port moliw, who wen, strageling, and as s punishment the Deputy Commimioner burnt the villeqe **and** killed a **conaidemble**

In the previou~l chapter it has been shown that the boundaries of Britieh territory have beeu slowly **end** gradually extended, **and** thie, where tho adjacent country ie oocupiod by **eewe** tribes, ie a proces~ that ie always liable to be continued.

under our protection, **and** the boundaries of the district **heve** wmrdingly **been** from time to time enhrged. In **1890, the oountry oooupied** by the Aw ww formed into the subdivision of Mokokchu~g, 'and in 1903, the area of what was known as the Political Control **waR** definitely incorporated in the district. 

The construction of tho railway through the Nambar foreat up to Lakhimpur has, on the other hand, rendered it ~aeier to administer the valley of the Dhansiri and the Mikir Hills from Nowgong **and** Golaghat, and in 1898, a large portion of the district of the Naga Hills wee transferred to Sibsagar and Nowgong. In 1901, the **area** of the district was 3,070 square miles, the population **was** 102,402, and the -density 83 to **tbe** 
square mile. The area of the Kohima subdivision was 2,837 square miles, and the density 29 to the square mile, while in Afokokchung, which aovered an **area,** of 738 aquare miles, there was a density of **416.** 
At first sight, these figures would suggest that the district is sparsely peopled, but this is not the cam. A country which is entirely composed of hille muet obviously include large tracts of land which are quite unfit for cultivation. Most of the remainder is only fit for *jhurrri~~g,* and **,ihztmin.g** postulates a large area of fallowing 1snd.a in parts of the district there is no doubt plenty of **waste** land on which **jhrm** crops might ~ily be **raised,** but this is not the case in the **Angsmi** territory.

like Khonoma are positi~ely pressed for land, and the people have carved out into terraced rice fields the most precipitous and unlikely looking slopes. 

In 1901 the district contained one town, if town it ~o-8 **vllla~es. and** 
can be called, and 292 villages. The Naga villages are very different from the straggling groves of plantains, palms, and bamboos, to mhich, in the plains, this name is usllally applied. They are generally built along the tops of bills, and in the old days of intertribal feuds wore fortified and entered through a village **gate.** 
In the plaios of Assam it is often hard to aay where one village ends and the next begins ; but there is none of this uncertainty in the Naga Hills. The Pillage is like a little town which ciften stands out sharp against the sky line, and it possesses distinct and **defiuite** village lands which are cultivated by its inhabitants, or are some times let to their less fortunate neighbours. 

Arno~igst~ the Aos and Lhotas the houses are generally arranged in regular ~treets alcng the tops of the ridge. lllle Angamis and the **Semas** place their houses in any locality within the village **wall** 
that seems convenient. Tho hill on which Rhonoma stands is **very** steep, and the houses are built on little terraces along the sides. The roof of one house is often scveral feet below the plii~th of its next-door neigllbour, and uomc of tl~e **villngc** paths are quite yrccipitouo. Building Iancl is very scarce, and a **uite ~Qill** 
fetch from Rs. 800 to Hs. 400. **Tli~** following description of An Ao village is take11 **from** C7olonel woodtllorpds R'eport on the Hurvcy operations in tho Nags liills in 1874-76, 
:' The villagee, wbioh are oeually large, **ee a rule** occupy the momt comma~lding points along tho ridges, and the approaches to them ere exceedingly pretty. Rroad roads, bordered with and low shrubs, lead up, through avenues of fine treee, ta the **main** entrance, which is gelierally very strongly guarded by two or three panjied ditches, running right across the ridge and stockaded on the inner bank. The stockades ar9 strongly bnilt of a double line of posts, supporting a wall of interlaced bamboo, and are capable of offering a good resistance. The ontermoet ditch is generally about 200 or 300 yarda, or even more, away from the village, the eecond being situated between it and the one enclosing the village. The gate through ihe stockade of this last ditch into tlle village is cut out of one huge block, end is.frequently four or five feet broad **find** about six A large gable roof is constructed over it, giving it a resemb **hi~hm** ence to our old lychgates et home. Lookouto ere built commandinq the entrance, and in Rome cnees little huts are condmckd in large trees outside the moet advanced stockadee on the main roads, communications being preserved with the interior by **means** of long ladders end ci~useways." 
Many of the village gates are still in exisfence, great doors made of thick planks, adorned on the outside with roughly carved bas-reliefa of animals and men. 

But they are almost invariably left open, **and,** even were they closed, **the** would-be-visitor woulcl hare no difficulty in walking round them.

The large& villages are to be found amongst the **E&sE** 
Angamis **and the Aos,** and some of tho more important ones almost attain the dignity of little towns. The village of Kohima, for instance, which stands on the hill just above Kohima station, contains over 800 houses, and has a population of naarly 3,000 souls. 

The staticjn of Kohima is eituated on a saddle on the waferehed, and' commands a fine view down the valley of the Rengmapa~ or **Zubea** to the north, and over a **graat** exysnee of hilly country **towarda** the eaet. There ie none of the fine open rolling country whioh k the great attmction of Shillong, and **the** roads are cut out along the rdgo of the hill-sides, which fall away in sharp ravines **from** the watershed. In the centre of the tiaddle stands the old fort, in which **are** situated the txewury, the magazine, the poet and telegraph office, and the oface of the Depufg. Commissioner. 

A little to the eaet, but lower down **the** hill, are the pmde ground and the quartero of the regimental oficere, with the **oepoye'** lines in the immediate vicinity. 

On the northern **~ide** of the addle **are** the military 6 police lines, the shops of tho few trader~ that the town possesses, and a very smell bazar, supplies being extremely scarce in Kohima. A little* further down the hill are the huts of a few Manipurie, Khwis, and Nagas who have left their native villages .to take up their residence in the metropolis of the district. The station is lighted by nine acetylene lamps, and has an excellent but somewhat scanty water-supply, which is brought from Polubadze hill, aid distributed by pipes all over the civil lines a~d thecantonment. 

Growth of the popu1.- 
It is difficult to measure the growth of the population. tion in the district. Tha first censlis mas taken in 1891, and, though a careful estimate was made in 1881, the district cis then constituted did not include the Mo kokchung subdivision (population 189 1-26,4116), 
and did include the valley of the Dhmsiri and the Mikir Hills, which, in 1898, were transferred to Sibsagar iecu...ea,s.ro and Nowgong. The abstract in the margin shows the 1881 ... 86 **887** 
1o01-.104~40a population based on the assumption that the boundaries of the district were the same in 1881 and 1891 aa they **were** at the last census. It will be seen that the increase is comparatively **small,** but the **Nape** 
are by no means a prolific race. In 1901, there were only 86 children under five for every 100 married women between 16 and 40, ee compared with 115 and 11 0 in Nowgong and Kamrup. The number of childleas married couples is unusually large, and even where a woman doe8 have children it is deldom that **sbe** 
becomes the mother of e large family. The Nagpride themselves on the strength md endurance of tl~cil* momenkincl, and **way** tlmt **ii:** these **reRyclctR** they ue little infe* to fit. **U~U.** These qualities have doubtless been developed by the continuous hard work they are called on to perform, and such development is not unfrequently attended by a wedenhg of the reprbdccti~e powers. The Semaa form an exception to the general rule, and this particular tribe is said to be incressing rapidly in numbers. 

There is little immigration info the hills, and **Imdm* tion.** 
in 1901, !X per cent. of the population had been born within the boundar;ies of the district, while another 4 per cent. were natives of Assam. Mast of the foreignere were Nepal-, who were either serving in the regiment. or the military police battalion, or had taken their discharge and settled down to cultivation. 

The- rest of the foreign population consisted of a few coolies **snd** cartmen from Bengal, and the United Provinces, a few arthaas from the Punjab, and a few tmdero from **Marwar.** Emigration from the district could not be measured with any degree of accuracy, owing to the changes in boundary that had recently taken place. A certain number of Nagas go down to the plaine in the cold weather to trade or to look for work on tea-gardens, but there is very little migration of a permanent character, the hi!lman seldom caring to leave his native village. 

In 1901, there wa. a preponderance of the male **g:;i~tPdidi** 
element in the population, tbera **boing** only 982 female~ "lun. 

to every 1,000 malee. This disproportion between the eexes is, however, entirely due to the foreignera, and among~t those born and censused in the dietriot the **number** of women **was** almost exsatly **equd** to the number of the men. Women are in a minority amongst the Angamis and the Kamha Nagas, and in a majority amongst the Lhotaa and the Aos. Infant marriage is practically unknown. Out of the **39,691** 
females in the district, who in 1901 had performed the marriage ceremony, only 114 were below the age of 1 Most of 'the tribes allow their girl8 grest liberty, not to say license, prior to their marriage, but so long aa they rcre living with their huebands they generally **make** faithful wivee. The-Lhotse are, however, an exception to this rule, and amongat them the mt!na.ge a **trois** is by no means unusual. Many of the customs that, govern the relations between the eexee are distinctly curious. The AngamiR, for instance, shave the heads of their unmarried girls, a faehion which pee Ear to counterbalance the effect of the good looks that many of them undoubtedly poeeeee. 

Bachelors, too, are required to wear their hair in a fringe which ie strongly euggeetive of a coeter belle and which is extremely unbecoming in oompmr;son with the **waving** looke that adorn the forehead of the married man. The different cuetoms of the vmrioue tribes w, however, ciiecussed at length in Mr. **Davis'** monograph on the Nagas, and need not be referred to here. The **dow** 
p;ronth of the popidation, to which reference hne been dresdg mde, ie, perhaps, to eome extant due to the faot thst the proportion of potential mothers, **i.e.,** of married women between 15 and **40 ia** below the Provinoialaverage, They foh only **119** per mille of the **(OW.** population u mmpued with 117 per mille in the **Pmvinoe of durn** 
rs a **whole,** and 170 per mille in €he Oentral Provinoee. 

From the following xbatract it will be seen that, **~nd.~mltiem.** 
though the district is singularly free from leprosy, deaf-mutism **and** blindness are extraordinarily common :-

The figurea given are for mele~ only, but deafmuti~m i~ almost aa ~revslent amongst the women, and blindness is even more common. The Deputy Commissioner, who was consulted as to the accuracy of the figures, **mote** as follows: I am not at **all** surpri~ed to hear that the rate is very high, as in almost every village, cerhbly amo~gat the Angamis, there ere deaf mntea. In some of the emaller **villages** every second pereon ia either deaf or dumb, or insane. This I know from my pereonal experience. l'he small villages to the north of Kohima a;re the worst in this respect. I can only attribute the prevalence of the infirmity to the reeulfe of intermarriage, and the fact that it is more prevalent in the ~mdler villages would corroborate this, as Nages, as a rule, marry in their own villages."

The numbers returned under each of tnese tribee st the census of 1901 will be found in Table 111, but since that date about 80,000 people, most of whom are Semas, have been included in the bnrrdaries of tho district. The most warlike and important of these tribes are the Angamis, who occupy the country in the neighbourhood of Euhime. North of them come the Rengmss, then the Lhot~, while north and east of tho LhotEIs are the Aos, whose villages stretch up to the Dikho river. The Semaa li~e eaat of the Rengmas and the doe. Full details with regard to the manners and customs of the various tribes of Nqas will be found in Wr. Davis' exhaustive trmtise on the s~tbject. The ouly other tribes that are fo~nd in any numbers in the district Rye the Krrcharia and the Kuli is. Accounts of theee tribes will be found in the Gazetteer of **Cachar,** a district to which they more properly belong. 

~.~l~lae The pest mass oi the **Nags8** are still faithful to the **religion** of their forefathers, and in 1001, 96 per amt. of the population were **dewribed** ur 'animi~t~ic. ' 
The people believe in the existence of 2- supreme creator, but, **aa,** like the Hindu Brahmrr, hia work is done, they do not trouhle themselves very 'much about him. 

Sickness md other misfortunes which befall them thoy to the ualignant action of evil spirits, who they ende$,vour to. propitiate with sacrifices. Xost of them believe that there is something in a man which sul-vives the death of the body, but what it is, and where it go$s, they cannot say. Further information on this subject will be found in Mr. Davis' monograph. 

Hindus formed 8 per cent. of the population, but practically all of them were foreigners. Hiuduism has no attraction for the Naga. In the plains converts gravitate towards it in obedience to the law which draws the smaller body towards the greater. A11 men like to follow the fashion, even though it may entail considerable personal inconvenience, so year by year the animistic tribes are abandoning their pork, ad fowl, and beer, though many a, longing eye is cast upon the flesh-pots of Egypt. But in the hills no distinction is conferrod by Hinduism, and nothi~g less than a strong desire for social advancement srolild induce a Naga **fcr** adopt a religion which would impose on him so many troublesome restrictions. 

Christianity, too, has as yet made little progress. 

In 1876, a branch of the American Baptist Mission was opened at Molung, which, in 1894, was transferred to Impur. About 1879, another member of thi~ Mission took up his resideilce at Kohima, and work1 was started amongst the Angami Nages. In 19041, there were altogether four missionrrries~ three af whom were msiefed by their wives, living amongst the **Naga** tribes. **The** 
number of Native Christians has increased, but progrssa has hitherto beec elow. In 2891, there were **211** Native Christians in the district; in 1901 there were 670, neatly all of whom vere Baptists. The **Nagm** is a much more conservative person than the Khasi, and fi~ds itdiacult to abandon the customs of his ancestors. 

Moat of them are fairly contented with their present mode of life, and it is hardly likely that there will be any general change of faith for soae time to come. 

MhO? RsUonr.-Bud- **The** abstract in the **margin** gives details for other 
\#',',dipz religioa~ which had but few representatives at the 143 ; **Jainm** 
SO; 8. time of the last censas. Nearly all of these personu were found in the station of Kohima. The Buddhists are Nepalese serving in the regiment or the military police; the Jaina are Bhop-keepers from Marwar, the Muhammadans artizans and traders. 

ompa- At the census of 1901 tlle occupatims of the people 
$i **anr.** were divided into 620 different heads, for which details will be found in the second volume of the Ceneus Report. 

This elaborate c:las~i ficntion **was** i~~tsnded for the more developed parts of India, ~nd the occupations of the natives of a hill district in Asearl1 practically begin and end with agriculture. Agriculture was the means of support of 93 per cent. of the population, but thaugh cultiration ia the mainstay of the Naga, he now and then combines it with some subsidiary occupation. Most of them, for instance, will do a little trading .if they can, and many of them turn out. to work as coolies during the cold weather. The soldiere and military polioeaen with their families **formed** 2 per cent. of the population tion, and 1 per cent. were described as beggars, though these were probably only aged and infirm persona **who** 
were supported by their relahives and friends. The number of persons returned under each of the eight main orders, and the proportion that they formed of the whole, waa as follows :-

~.ti~a TEE ordhsry method of cultivation practised in the hills is the system know11 as *jhrau.* The jungle growing on the hill-side ie cut down, left for six weeka or so to dry, and burned between January **and** Bhv.h. The- bougbs of larger trees, and **any** rubbish that wm not consumed in the first conflagration are then **collectad** and burnt, and the ground hoed up. 

The **mile** of hill rice, millet, and job's- tears are mattered amongst the ashes, or dibbled in, **and** the **fields** careinUy **raked** over till they are quite smooth. While tho crop is **prowing** it is weeded once or twice. Thp millet i~ 
harvested in July, the rice in November, and the job'stears in the following month. Chilliee, pumpkins, and til **are** alao grown in tho **J~~LCWP,** and on the elopes af the lower **hills** above Golaghat cotton ie en important CrDP-The system of *jhvm* cultivation ha8 bveral drawbacks. **The** crop is entirely dependent on the rainfall fm the moisture it requires to bring it to *mahriQ,* much time and troubie has to be expended in the clearing of the *jh%ms,* snd the'amou~t cf land required ia vory large. A j5um is, as a rule, only cnltivated for two seasons in succession and thsn allowed to fallow for aeven or eight years. After the **sand** year, the yield falls **off,** and the weecle spring up **and** 
choke the crop. There is a, **risk,** too, .that the mots of the ecrub jungle may be killed ; and the land depends to Home extent for its fertility on the regrowth of this ju~gle, and ite subsequent conversion **into** a bed of mh mannra. A village thus requires of culturable land about five times the area actually under cultivation at any given timo, and th'e outlying *jhums* of the **larger** 
communities must, of necessity, be sometimes **bitnated** 
at s considerable distance from the village sib. On the otber hand the **yield** of the *jhum* ie largo, and as **long ae** 
they **bave** suBciont land avdaie the **Nap awm** to prafer *jhzcmhtg* to **any** other ,eyetern of cultivation. 

A considerable arce is **jhmed** by the Angmi Nagaa, ~a e,tenwea oult~ratlon but their desirt! for **rics,** which does not do well in *jhuw* zp" mmat an elevaticn of more then 4,000 fentv~bova the level of the **sea!** a,nd the pressure of population on the mil, ha8 driven them to **adoph** the aptern of terraced cu1,tivation. The slopes of the **hills** below their villagc~ are cut out into a euccession of terraces, wbich are irrigatad from the hlll etrenmrr, **vhone** water is cnrefully distributed through littlle channels over every **shep in the seriea. Whnn** the slope is fairly gonth these **tIerrwoco** are **eome$imos** nearly twenty ysrdr in breadth and not more than two feet high ; but fields se large aa this are by no means common. The average terrace is more than three feet high, and is not more than three or four yards wide, and is often built up with stone retaining walls. In places these stone walls are as much as five fee! high, in places the terraces ara not more than two feet wide, and as they have to follow the contour of the hill-side they are never of any considerabb length. 

An ample supply of water is an absolute necessity for terraaed cultivation, and, where this is to be had, Gelde are cut out on slopes which are alm9st precipitous in their eteepnoas. Sometimes the terraces are simply dug out of the emth and are not faced with stone, but near Khonoma they evan go so far 8s to build low malls across their *jhum* land to prevent the soil from being washed away by the rain. This system of terraced cultivation mas probably introduced from the south, and without it the large and populous Amgami villages could not exist, a~ they have not sufficient land in their vicinity to support them by the wasteful system of *jh1~1nin.g* . 

Tho initial labour required to make theae terraced fields is very great, but, once made,'they give less trouble than s *jhm.* They are close to the village site, and jungle clearing is not necessary. Many of these terraces are almost entirely dependent on the rainfall, and fields which can bc! kept under water during the cold w **entLcr** are particularly valuabls. This irrigated rice ie raised in the same way as tho aali *dhun* of Assam. The soil ie thorough1 y saturated with moisture, **and** then held up till it ir reduced to a rich puddle. The rim has in the been sown on the hill-side, when the plrnts are from a month tc six weeks old, they are trBnsphnted into the fields. Harvesting goes **on in** December; the ears are cut off short by the head and threshed in the field before being carried up to the rillage. 

The Angamis generally **storo** their grain in the h0me in huge baht8 about four feet high and pruportionately wide, but most of the tribes keep it in granaries outaide the **villaga, born** fear of **fire** or rats. There is nothing, except his sense of honour and the fieverity of the punishment that would follow on detection, to prevenf a man from helping himself to his neighbour's **grain** ; and tbe exist;ence of this custom is a striking testimony to the high atactlard of honesty observed in their relatione with on0 anothb. 

Amongst other crops tohe Nagas raise cucumbere; Other **cravr.** 
gourd\#, a bean not unlike a large variety of French bean, and a little indigo, which is intonded eolely for home use. A few plants of tobacco are also grown in the village, and the fibre of n nettle is used for thread though the plant is hardly oilltivated in the sense in which that tern is usually employed. Attempts have been made to introduce **the** cultivation of potatoes, but they are at preherit chiefly **grown by** foreign settlers in the oeighbourhod of Kohima. Tho Nagas are not such radicsls and pmpeesivss NI the Khssie, and are not so rearip to absndon the traditions of their ancestors. *Cotton* i~ grown by Lh~b Nsga~ on the he:ower hill^, and in **1903-04,** 
it estimsted that about **4,bOO** mailads were exported &laghat. Mabe is **grown,** but is not much in favour with the **Raps,** and is generally roilled by foreigners residing in the district. Oranges are planted by the Lhota~ and Aos on the hills tverlooking the Sibsagar district, and peaches, pears, pineepples, leechees, mangoes, a=ld European vegetables do well in the lower hills, though they have not yet been adopted by the Naw=

In their natural **state** the hills were origiudb **FO*'u*** 
clothed with evergreen forest. Thia forest still remainu on the more precipitons slopee and in the valley bottoms, but from most of the hill-sides the trees have vaniehed before the **dao** and torch of the cultivator, and the sitee of fallowing *jhs* are generally covered by a dense jungle of bamboos. There io only one reserved forest in the diatriet, which is situated on the borders of Sibwgar, at the point where the Disai rivsr debouches on the plains. This reserve wl~s constituted in 1902, and covers an area of 88 square mileu. The forest covers the low outlying hills aid the intervening valleys, and contains nahor (mesu,~. .fewen), ajhar (la,gerstramin jlos regiw), titmapa *(miehelia* champaca), sam (artocmrpus ohaplasha), poma (ccdrela toona), pnserai (cinwamom,um glundztl(femm), amari (amoora spectnbili.~), khakrtn

Iron work and pottery. Village blacksmiths make **dm~,** spear-heads, hoes, and **knives** from imported iron. The iron-work is of a. very simple character, but the shafts of the spears and the handles of the daos are sometimes decorated with goats' hair, dyed dark-blue, white, and red.

The climate is cloubtloss favoural~le for sericulture, 'out the dirt of tlie Naga vil;age is likely to prejuclicially affect thc worm. 

The standard of moasurement for Naga **land** is not **%nt..** 
area, but the number of loads of paddy that it yielda. 

Terraced rice lend is both eold **and** let,. Some years ago, when the construction of the cert **road** had put a great qunutity of monej in circulation in the district, rupees, as the Naga expresses it, mere ' cheap.' An acre of terraced rice land near **Khonomtc** at tha5 tiae fetchdas much cs Rs. 600 ; but **now,** that rupees are 'dear,' it **can** 
be bougbt for abnt **me-third of** that sum. An acre of terraced rice land let8 from three to **nine** rupees a yesr mrding to quaiby, while an sore d jhtcm hod CM b: 
rented for the two seaaons, **during** which it is cultivshd for 8 mpee and a half. It mnat, however, be borne in mind that the abaence of any syc~tem of measurement renders the **exact** pitch of these rents a little doubtful. 

wu-. During the cold weather **Nagas** will work fairly redily on the road for six annas a. day. **Off** the cart mad, coolies are tha usual meams of transport, and recoive eight annas a march near Kohima, and from four to eight annm in the eaatern part of the district. The pyemment rate is usually accepted by the **Nagas** a8 thew standard in their dealings with one another, but au I oxchange of labour often obviates the necessity lor making any actual money papest. 

mom **The** price of rice is not of much importance except to the foreign population, as tho N3gas seldom eithsr buy or eell. Since the conf~truction of the cart road, rice has bn comparatively cheap at Kohima, as it is importled from Manipur. Bet,ween **1898-08** and 1902-03, it ra~ged from Re. 1-14 to Rs. 9-8 per maund, which was very much lese than the prices previously ruling in the brtzar. 

In **1903-041,** it auddenly rose to Rs. 6-4 per maund, as it wa feared that, owing to the omallnose of the rpinfa?l, the harvest in Manipur would be a ver,v poor *one.* 
Since the wmpletion of the railway to **Dimapur,** there hss been a great reduction in the chargea on acro~int of frieght, **and** a consequent general fall in prices. L)el and dt eold respectively for Re. 11 and Rs. 10 per maund in **1896-87,** butl in **1303-041,** tihey were selling for Re. 6-8-0 and RE. **4-8-0** per maund. 

rod, The staple food of the people is **rioe,** but the Nagss at **meat** whenever they cen get it, and me quib ind&mnt to the **stage** 01 putrefaction that it **may** 
have reached. **Beef** and pork are probably more often eahn thm other **kinds** of flesh, but this is only because they are more eady procurable. Roashd dog is much esteemd, and, apart trom milk, there is hardly anythi6g which the Nsgb will not eat. Why they abstain from millt ia **not** quite clear. They do not **wem** to have any prejudics ageinst it, but say that they have never lomt fo milk their cows, and that if the calf is deprived of milk it cannot thrive. They have no pre j~- 
dice against the leavings of a European, and a Naga gladly accepts anything that may be over from the Saheb's lunch, end picks the chicken bones as cleanly as a dog. When a cow is killed the bones ere not thrown ewey till every particle of flesh hae been gnawad off them, and the houees often reek with tho stench of them putrifying fragments. All the tribes consume enormous quantities of rice beer, which seems to serva as food as well as drink. The way in which this beer is brewed is described in the paragraph on excise. 

The dress of the **Nagoe** varies **from** zero to a corn- **Drear.** 
psratively high figure, both **from** the point of vlem of quantity and quality. The drees of the naked **Nagbe,** who live in the extreme north-east corner of the dietrich, consists of a few strips of blackened cane or a broad stmp of white **bark,** bound tightly round the waist, a Large **tail** of bark being often left hanging down behind. 

The *hgami* **h'aga,** on the oiihor hand, will weer in the winter **aa many aa** four large shawla, which afford a rdy effioient protwiion agdinst the cold. 

Their ad blue **kilte** re offen embroidered with cowries ; and their gaily -r;~l.~ured cane gaiters, their ornaments of pigsJ tushes. and their coliarettea **and** 
armleta of goats' hair dyed flaming red, are remarkably effective and picturesque. 

~oumr. The Nags house is almost invariably dark and dirty, but the style of building differs very oonsiderabl J 
'amongst the different tribes. The A~gami house is fwd with planks, and has a thatched **roof** that slopes from the ridgo pole to with= a few feet of the ground. The aide walls are made of reeds, or thatch, or **planks,** and, ae they have no mindowe, the interior of the buildiq is extremely dark. A fsic-siaed house is about 28 feet long and 22 feet broad, and the roof **projecta** 
some four fest more in front of the front **wd,** thus forming a small porch. The hause is divided into three rooms. In **the** outer room sfand the huge baskets iu which the rice is stored, and it ia here that the cattle are stalbled for the night. In the inner rooms the family cook, **and** eat, and sleep. An **hgnmi** house is usually a very filthy place. The floor is made of 
&h, fowls and cattle live with the famlly, **and** in addition to this there is of ten a horrible stenoh from putrifying fleah. The people sleep on pianks, **and** for their bedding use a quilt made out of old olothea patched together. 

The houses of the wealthy men of the village are 
' built on **the same** plan but are larger, and the planks in front are sometimee odorned **with** simple carvings. 

If the omer haa performed a special *ghennca,* he ie 
.Iloned to put np two curved **barns** in the front of the houee, which **meot** over the roof tree in the fm af how, and are a oonepicuour **feature** in an Anpi village. The houses of the othcr tribe8 differ to some extent from those of the Angamis, **and** are described at length in Mr. Davis' Monograpl~. 

Most of the Nagas have a sufficiency of food and 2clothing, but there is little accumulbted capital, and **thepeOP1e.** some villages are said to experience difficillty in raising the very moderate revenue imposed on them. Apart fi~m **tha** cotton, chillies, and pan exported to Golaghat, there is nothing grown for sale, and cash is generally obtained by- working **far** the Public **Works** Department, and occasionally on tea-gardens in the wirrt,er iime. The caeh expenditure of the people is, however,' very amall, and gensrally they seem fairly wellto-do. The following account is token from the repwt of the Deputy Commissioner in **1901-02** :- 
"Rather than cultivate euffioieut rice to supply th4r wants, the Kukis prefel* to lord, and to subeist towards the end of tho season (ril jungle roots and plnuts. The Each Nagna are nearly ae bed. One would think they would be glad to earn a little money by workiug 011 the bridle path, and doing cooly work, but this is not the case. **'l'hej** never lose an opportunity of **trying** 
to pet out of doi~g the very srcd1 nmount of **cooljr** work which they are called npon to perform. Thc other tribes in the district, oxcept the people of Temlu, who are corllirmed apium-eetcre, are extremdy induntrioua lnci ':1~1.d-working, and nithal light-hearted and gmd-tempered. It is pleasent. to see them tradging up to their villegee et. dusk, aiugiog **and** latghing after a long day'u work.

T~ives are not ~~nfrequentlyost in **these** riote, but homicides of this character are far less objectionable 3han the muriers which are still occosionally committed from the simple lust of killing. In 1896, a Garo chaukidar, his wife a **Nagini,** their baby, and mother **Naga** were murderod within fifteen miles of Kohims, from the aheer joy of slahghter; and head-taking is still in **full** wing on the eastern ~ide of the Dikho. In 1900, when the Deputy Commissioner was touring in thaae hills **lio wee** informed that the village of Yajim **had** recently raided rn Kamahu, and had taken sixty heeds, most of which had belonged to defenceless women **and** children. The 
@ant head-hanter avoida as **far aa pomible** all riek of opposition, and mu& **prefem** to take che heed of an unarmed child to killing r, fnll-grown man in open

The rules provide for the trial of petty **cws** b the village elder@, but most of the **X.ga** villages are **very** 
demmretic in their ~nstit~ztiona, and **fhero are fesR** people ot Ruficiant weight and influeno6 to **be able** to enforce obedience from an unsucce86fbl **btig8nt. A** nag^ trial is rather a curious epestacle. The **two** partiea **stand** 
before the ceat of justice, separated by one or more interpreters, with whom they engage in tho most mimated converse. The proceedings are generally of a, very friendly nature, axid if one of the parties can be induced to swear to anything, the other side are generally prepared to accept the statement sworn to as correct. The administration of the oath is, however, a very solemn businesh. The juror unties the little **.tag** of hair at the back of his head, and the spectators all take care to see that his cloth is worn the right side up and hie shoulder bare, as the neglect of these formalities wculd render it poosible for him to indulge in perjury with impunity. The juror states his cme at length and sweare that t11i.r statement is correct, praying that, if he lies, both he and all his family may corne to a apeedy and a violent end. The by-standers listen with the greatest of attention, and are quick to detect and object to any variation in the form of oath which custom ha prescribed. Onco the oath **has** been duly swcjrn the other party departs completely satiafied. At, first sight it seeme strange that s~!cE cases should not be settled out, of court, but it is said that if tohe dispute ie decided In the village, there is risk of the parties coming to blows; and with people whose nrst.ura1 **inatinoh**

It contains ~ccornrnodation for taenty-a~lr convicts, and ten sick and nnd~r-trial priaonere.

There is a middle English school ~t, Kohima which, in 1908-04, had a daily average attendance af seventy-seven boys, **but** not more than nino or ten sere the eons of natives of the dietrict. On March 81st, **1904,** there were six loner primary schools maintained by Government, at Mokokchung, Wokha, Henims, Khonoma, Jakhama, and Cheuwejuma, which had altogether a daily avorage attendance of one hundred and ten pupils, and eixteen Mission echoole* which receive grants-in-aid from Government. Thero are aleo two training whoole at Kohima and Impur. Arrangements have recently heen made to teach the Angamie and Aos to reed and write their own lenguago in the English character, as the Naga hes no written ch~racter of ite 3wn. **Thie** marks a great advance on the former ayefern under> which boys were taught to road **and** writm in Asssmeee, but it is at preeent eubject to the drawback **that** there am very few printed books in do or Anpni. **Naga boys** have acoordingly to be tIsught b road **from** the **Gospel 8ooording** to St. John, or the Acts of the Apostles, ~v-kich must be **rether**

There were altogether 571 boys and 76 girla st school in **1W3-04~, or 4** per cent. cf the children of sahool-going age, but the Nap have not yet learned the admantagee of education, and a certain amount of juaiicioue preeeuw is roquired to induce them to send their children to be taugb.t. 

~.dior~ The district is in the charge of a Civil Burgeon, and contains two hoepitals, situated at Kohima (ten beds), and Wokha (fcur beds), and one dispensary at Mokokcbung. 

Vital statistics are orly recorded at Kohima, so that there is no detailed information available with regard to the mcrtna~ etatietics of the people. Melarial fever and lung affwfions are probably responsible for 8 coneiderable proportion of the total casualties, md epidemice of measles and influenza occasionally claim a long tale of victims. Dyeentory and cholera eometimev appear am,>ngef **the** lower villages, hut cholera is fortunately comparatively rare. The hilimen have a wbo~esome dread of infection, and do not scruple ta evacuate 8 rillago if the circumstancss are sufficiently aerious to wamnt such a measure. The following de~cription of the conduct of the Samaguting Nagas when confronted by a eingle **case** of dxrsll-pox is taken Prom a report b7 Mr. Csmeg~ in **1877.** :-

Wherr they fairly mtisfied themselves that no on0 but the **Kuki** 
had been ill, they mere rather **a~ha:ned** of ru18ni11g away ; **but it was** 
not until some time after when **they** saw him goi~~g about, very litlle the **worse** in appearallce, thnt **the** idea **tlrrrt Ile** had beer1 burnf a!ive wne abandoced. Befora, nothing would persuade them **this-h~d** not been done, iZ being looked qpon ne merely a wise precautionary measnro for **wlrich wa deserved credit.** 
Their fear8 are apparently &ill strong, but they take the more sensible precaution of submitting to the process of vaccination. During the **five** yeara ending with **1002-** 03, seventy-six per mille of the population were successfully vaccinated every year ; s proportion that was higher than that reported **from** any district in the Provinee except the Claro Hills. Nothing could well exceed the dirt of the Naga villages and houses, and were it not for the very. eanitary character of the **sihe:** they could hardly fail to become veritable hot-beds of disease. But they are generally built on the very summita of the hills, and there are no fruit $rees or bamboo jungle to deprive them of the purifying influences of the sun and air. The people, too, have the sense to wrap up warmly in the cold weather, a sensible precaution which savea them no doubt from many chills. In tho absence of all statistics it is difficult to say whether tlh3 daath rate is high or not. The Nagaa do **not** increase rapidly in numbers, but this **may** possibly bo dlle more to 6 low birth-rats thhn **ti,** a high mortality. 

Venereal diseaees are not very prevalent amongst the Angamis, but are unfortunately common in the Ao oountry, and their **diseemination** is facilitatdd by the cuatoms of the people. In 1903, there were morecmae of primary and seco~dary sgphilis treated at the Kohima and %.fokdkchung dis~errsaries than at any other two dispensaries in the Province. In '904 the yropbrtion of the population trertted iz? the district dispensaries for syphilis was ten times greater than theljroportion h **the** 
Provirlce as a whole.

THE Native State of Manipur is situated between **~g,g:~,** 
28" **60'** and **25"** 41 N. and 93" 2' and **94'47** E. and covers an area of 8,456 square milee. On the north it is bounded by the British district of the Naga Hills, on the weet by Cachar, on the south by the Lu~hai Hills and Burma, and on the east by Burma. 

The greater part of the State consists of ranges of hills whose general trend is north and south. Towards the east tho direction of the upthrust is not so well de- 
. 

fined, and the country lying between Manipur rcnd the Kubo Valley consists of a tumbled m%sQ of hills, with rc general tendency to run east and west. In the centre of the State is the valley of Manipur, which is about 80 miles in length and 20 in broadth. Lines of low hils, which crop up here and there above the dluvium, suggest that the formation of the valley was **originally** 
much' the some R. **tb~t of %he** surro~inding hills, a.nd that it mnsieted of two or more ohaina of mo~mtains running north and south, with deep valleys in between. These ranges were, however, ooneiderably lower than those that now surround them. It has generally been thought by mo3t obasners that the Manipur Valley wae originally B lake. This theory was, however, rejected by Ms R. D. Ollham of the Geologioal Survey Department, who pointed out that, had it been correct, there would have been the rem~ins of terracee formed by the cutting down of the outlet.* 
The following list of the hill ranges of Manipur ie taken from the *Gazettem* by Oaptain Dun. The rangee on the weet are-(1) Kunjaibong; (a) Kalanage; (3) 
Chakke-Nungba ; (4) Kanpum (yeally only a epur from tho Laimatol) ; (6) Kopru-Laimatol. On the north- 
(I) The Kunho apure; (a) Thumion-Mayrtng-Khang; 
(8) Laisom ; (4) Sirohifare. On the **east--(l)** Sarameti or Ching-angauba; (2) 8omra; (8) Kassom; (4) 
Nupitel or Mapethe; (5) Yomadung. On the south- 
(1) Haobi. 

The greatest altitude is attained in the extreme north, where M~Q thana ia overhung by a peak nearly 10,000 feet above the level of the eea. The hills run, ae e rule, in iwogular eerrated ridges, rising here and them into peab; but weat of the valley assume a more dpea and rolling character. Between Cachar and Manipur, thoy are covered with dense evergreen foreata and bamboo jungle. In the county to the west pine treee are common ; but round the valley itself, and along the Kohima road there is comparatively little tree growth, and the sides of the hills are, for the mo~t ~ait, covered with grass. The ranges are, as a rule, composed of soft grey shale, which ia very liable to slip when exposed to the action of the rain and air. The slope is fairly easy till near the summit, which is often rocky and precipitous. 

The rivers of the valley take their rise in the hills **mvem** 
towards the north. On the eaat is .the Thobd, 'which rises in the hills-not far from Ukrul. West of the Thobal is the Iril, which rises about fifteen milea eaet of Maram, and, after skirting the town of Imphd, falls, like the Thobal, into the Imphal river. Through the capital itself flow the Imphal and the **Nambol.** The last-named river. falls into the Lokhk, from which it emerges under the name of Kortak. This stream eventually joins the Imphal, and another river called Nambol, which rises near Kangjupkul and **flowe** to the west of Imphal and the Loktak. Their united watem, which are known as the Achauba, Imphal, or **Manipur** river, linnlly fall into the Kendat and thus into the Chindwin. In thc hills these rivers are bright and sparkling a$.ams, flowing along over their rocky bede, but in the valley they assume the disagreeable characteristics often found in tho rivers that traverse an alluvial plain. In **the** cold weather they are shallow muddy etreams, **creeping** along at the bottom of the deep channels which they **h~ve** 
cut through the alluvium, but ii~ times of fld they riee to a considerable height and sometimes **ov&p** 
their banks. In the dry seaeon they are **only** navigable by canoes, and, though in the rains th im a 
~ndedde depth of **water,** country boats of a larger size qDib mkmnvn. Attempts were made to introduce tbam **after** 1891, but they were not received with favour, md the anipuria evidently find their small canoes sdcient for the sllort journeys they perform. 

HLL~ rl~~m. In the eaatern hills there arb numerous small streams which drain into the Yu and thence into the Chindwin. 

TheJ flow through deep valleys, and are liable to sudden floods which render them difficult to cross, but only one of **them, the** Maglang, has any cleptli of water in the the winter. The principal rivers in the western hills are^ **the** Bad and **its** tributary the Irang. The Barak rime &out **ten** miles east of Mao thana, and flowe a w&lj come as far as Kairong, whore it crosses the Mnnipur-Kohima cart-road. Here it takes a bend towards the north, and then turns westward, till it reachee the north-west corner of the State. The river then **cume** away towards ths south, and flow^ the whole way to, Tipaimukh, which till lately was the tri-junction point of Manipur, Cachar **and** the Lushai Hdh, **akmg** the eastern side of the last main range of hille which separates Cachar from Mmipur. At Tipaimukh the Barak turne sharply to the north, and, as far **eq,** Jirighat, flows almost parallel with, though in **the opposite** direction to, the section of the river that lice between Kalanaga and Tipaimukh. In thib portion of ita course it forms **t,he** boundary between hbu md Menipur, but at Jirighat it turne egain to fhe and, **aftor** a tortuoue couree through the dm of Cacher and Sylhet, **fslle** into the old bed of **tbe** Brdmeputra near Bhairab **barar.** The prinoipel tributary of the Bd is the Irang, whioh rises s little to the west of Khirong, and falls into it **about** 
20 milea north of Tipaimukh. Two other rivers of mme importance, cros~ed by the traveller **from Chhar** to Manipur, are the Jiri, whioh for s considerable **distsnce** 
forms the western boundery of the **Stab,** and the Makru. None of the 0th streams that flow along the valley8 and carry **off** the drainage of the dopes on either side are of sufficient eke to merit **special** mention. In the dm season **the** hill rivers oonsiat, as a rule, of still deep pools linked together by ehallow rocky roaches. In the rains they are liable to sudden freshets, and, though thera is no very great depth of water in the river, the current is extremely swift and strong. The Barak at Keirong only mntains a, few inches of water in **tlhe** old weather, but, during the rains, carts used sometimes to be detained for **eeveral** days till the subsidence of the flood. 

The Loktsk is the largest ~heet of water in the Pmvince of Assam, and ie said to be sight milea long and five miles wide st the broade~t part.* It is a **broad,** shallow, sheet of water, **and** is juet auoh cs pool **aa ie** left in a saucer-liko deprss8ion **whan** a marsh driee **up.-** Viewed ' from above, the apyosranco of the Loktak is distinctly tame, iind there is nothing romantic or pictureque in its eurroundings. Ordinary weter meadowe, **deetitnte** 
alike of reeds and treee, gradually merge into s **shallow**

mere. On the western side there aro tho remains of a **row of hills,** whose bases have evidently been submerged beneath the. alluvium, and whose summits now form steep and precipitous ialends. The largest of tha~e is called **Tsogs,** end is s place to which criminals used oocasiondy to be deported in the days of native rule. 

Here and there on the broad -surface of the lake are floating islets, fo~med from the matted roots of aquatic plante. &me of the larger ones are used as camping placee by the fisher folk, who build their **hutls** there, though the idand rocks at each step and the water ooms up in eaoh footprint. But, like the **margin** of the lako, they am destitute of **any** growth of reeds, and this absenw of anything to break the even level of the view deprivea the Loktak of any claim to beauty. 

Other mr. 1)otted about the valley are numerous jhils which only differ from the Loktak in point of size and depth. 

Many of them, in fact, dry up completely in the winter time,or only conbin a few pools in the lowest levels. The Lumphel and Tayeljhils near Imphal %re valuable as gra,zing The Waithou Shorien, the Waithou Phoomnew, the Ekope, Kajipat, and Poomlen *jhib* are sold for coneiderable sums as fieheries. These, however, are bat a few of the most ihportant marahes in the valley, and, dnring the rainy season, thero are probably between sixty md seventy sheets of water, some small, some large, but dl **alike** posuessed of the prevailing characterietice. 

~IIO~ **6- The** traveller who enters Manipur by the Cachar mad **obtains** a magnificent view of the **valley** from the summit of the Laimetol hill. For severe1 days his path has lain across range aftor range of mountains, covered with forest so dense that it is seldom that he can see se much as a quarter of a mile before him. Suddenly all is changed The eastern face of the hill, as it slopes befor0 him to the valley, is covered with short grass, and rolling downs take the place of the dense tropical forest that lies concealed on the wastern side of the ridge. 

The valley lies before him like 6 map. At the northern end, some twenty miles away, are the dark-green groves that conceal the town of Imphel. Elsewhere are level rice fields, and lma covered with grass, about which are dotted the clumps oE trees that mark the villages. These villages are much more scattered then thej are in the densely populated portions of Assam. They do not stretch in one long continuous line, but. stand out here and there, clear and well defined, and there is many a, square mile of land without a trace of human habitation. 

Low ridges of hille stand up above the alluvium,- and sheeta of water gleam in theildallow depressions on the plain. To the south, the Loktak spwkles in the sun, and on every side the **P;iew** is bounded by hills. But, unlike tbe **moumtaind thb:** shut in the two great vdeys of bessm, they we almost destitute of troes, and nowhere in the valley is there thst rank growth of vegetation which ie so dietinguiehing a oharacteristic of the British Provinoe. 

Lying ae it does st an elevation of 2,600 feet above **01im.t.** md Bblnfdl. the level of the sw, the climate of the valley is generally cool and pleasant. No **record0** of temperature are kept, but it is **mid** that at the hottest season of the.yearthe thermometer in tho residenq seldom rises above 83" Fahrenheit.' The average rainfall at Imphal is about 76 inohee in the par, but it is much more **hriable tb.p** 
is usual in Assam. In 1896-97, it wee 57 inches, while in 1899-1900, it was over 100. The rainfall in the same year at **Ulrrul,** about 85 miles north-eaat of Imphal **and** about 6,000 feet above the level of the sea, **was** only 68 inchee. About half the ram falls in the three months June to August, and the spring rains are not so heavy as in many places in Assam. The average rainfall recorded in each month will be found in Table I. 

The prevailing winds are from the south and west. 

Storms and destructive cyclones are far from common, but, at Moirang, a special puja is performed each year with the object of warding off calamities of this kind. 

The village ctt this time does a regular Naga *gltennu,* and for five days no one is allowed to enter or leave its precincts. 

krthqurl.~. On January loth, 1869, a severs shock of earthquake was felt at Manipur. The Raja's honse, which **was** 
built of brick, collapsed, killing four pereons and wounding several more. The upper story of the residency subsided, the treasury mas levelled with the ground, **and** 
n umerol;s other buildiuge wrecked. The ground opened and sand and mud were opouted forth, and the beds of the river8 wore choked by the *dsbriv* which fell into them.+ The only pereons in the State, who **wero** known to have been killed by the earthquake, **wero** the four who 
' were buried in **the** ruins of the R~ja'a pil~ce. The

The ground rooked. **trees** waved to and fro as though exposed to a storm, and the houses swayed. The eotual damage done **was,** however, insignificant, and, in the opinion of the Political Agent, the shock was not strong enough to injure **any** well-built building. 

The larger kinds of fauna are not nearly so **g{zBh** 
numerous as in the Brahmaputra Valley, in spite of the fact that a great portion of the State is very spareely peopled. . Elephants are found, but are by no means common. The bison or mithun (bos gcrurus) 
is occasionally seen, but wild buffalo are quite unknown. 

Of deer there are severel varieties : **tho** sambar (cervu~ 
W~O~OT), the barasingha (cervus d~~vctuceli), the hog deer, 
(cervus porciqzus), the barking deer (cervulus **mun,tjac)** and the Manipuri deer or sang~zai (cervus eldi), which' is found not only in Manipur but in Burma, the **Malay** 
Peninsula, Cambodia, and Hainan. Stags of the latter variety stand about 46 inches at the shoulder, and are fawn-coloured in summer and of a darker hue in winter; does are a little smaller and of a fairer colour. The horns have an extremely long curved brow-antler, joining tohe beam in such a rna~~ner that the two form one continuous curve at right angles to the pediccl. Tho heam is oubrnnchcd for a considerable distance, generally more than half the length, and curved backwards, then outward~, and lastly forwards ; towards the end it bears a **number** of small points. These deer are no longer common, and **are** genedy to be found in swampy ground. 

Leopards are fairly common, and tigem are a occasionally killed. Two varieties of black be~r me fonnd in the hills, and in tho topa of the highest mouutain~ 
the aerow is occsaionally to be seen. 0th~ snirnala include wild cab, wild pigs, which are faily common, otters, monkeys, and rate. Rats occasionally do much damage in the hills by consuming all the grain. They aro specially voracious in the south, where Manipur adjoins the Lu~hai country, and in the Lushai Hills they once produced an actual famine. Wild duck of various kinds, and wild geesa are extraordinarily plmtiful, and the surface of the Loktak **ie-** often covered with these birds. Hume's yheaasnt *(plmrt*an;ua* **hum&)** is found in Manipur, in addition to the peltcock pheasant 
(polyplectrum) and tho ordinary **KKij** pheasant. There is oxcellent snipe shooting, and partridges, wood cock, and jungle fowl **(galkta** *fenaginau)* are duo to be **had.** Cobras and other poisonous- **snakes** are rare, but harmless snakes are not uncommon. Large python are **fonnd** in the moist **-warm** valleys that separate the rangee **tliat,**

Hiufory of Polit,ical lLgency--Unsatisfactory positiom of Apnt Turbulcncc of hill tribes in 1891 THE origin of the Manipuris, aa of the other hill tribes **==ha** 
on the frontier, must always be a matter of uncertainty. McCulloch reports that, according to the rno~lt credible traditions, the valley **was** originally mupied by several tribes, the principa! of which were named, Koomal, Loomg, Moirang, and Meithei, all of whom came from different quartere of the compaae. 

The Koomal **are** mid to **have** been originally the moet powerful and after them the Moirang; but ultimately Zhe Meithei subdued them all and formed them **into** a eingle people. Tradition says that the Moimngs came from the mouth, the country of the Kukis and the **Chins;** the Koomal from the **east,** whero tho Tankuls now are found; and the Meithei and **Looang** from the hille to the northwmt, which - at preeent occupied by the Kapuie and the Bhmm Nagaa* Mc Culloch, with whom Rrown agreee, ie of opinion that the Manipuris are deecended hm the Mbes inhabiting the hills that surround the dey, and baeee his opinion on their own traditions, on philologid affinitiee, and on thc fact that the ceremony of wending the throne is performod in Naga drew, **whilo** the *Zirncknzo* or ' great house,' the original residence of the bill chief, is built in Naga fashion. 

The Manipuris, it should be mid, deny that the costumtt in question is in any way peculiar to the Nrtgae, and a small eection of them lay claim to a western an8 Hindu descent. 

Il.rlr trMu-
WOM of According to McCulloch (p. 5) the records of Mmipm- &nipur contain a long list of chiefs, a list of names and of very little more. Yemberton reports that Manipur wae visited by Samlongpha, brother of the king of Pong, **towards** the close of tho eighth century ***4.l). t IIe** 
had been on a raiding expedition through Cschar and Tipjmra, and descended into the valley near Moirang, a vilLago on the western shore of the Loktak **lake.** He ordered the **people of** Moirang to **makc** n yearly **offcling** 
to the ld **gods,** and visit.ed the Meittheis, who were not mewed fo tribute, but were ordered to dress morc ilcmay and to chew pan in place of the piece^ of dried fi~h

Khumbat, but he was promptly attacked and ~nquered by the combined forces of lJong and Manipur. Ilia tcrritorias were made over to the Meithei chief, **and** the vdey **was** 
visited by the Pong king who directed that the old form of Nage house ~hould be abandoned and the BO-called "long fied house" ~hould be adopted in its stead. He also presented the Raja with a golden *pandlran,* a silver mounted dw, and a litter, which, with a sacred spear,- were for many years the insignia of royalty. The last of these articles, the golden pandhan, dieappeared in 1860, when it was carried off by Raja Debendro Singh. 

The modern history of Manipur may be said to date P enherbs OT 
Oharib from 1714, when Psnheiba, or Qharib Nawaz, acciden- - Nawsn **1764,** A 1714 D.

Uy shot his adopted father and thereby cleared his way to the throne. According fo one account, Panheiba was a N~hy who had been adopbd by the Raja. 

Othere say that he **wae** the Itsja'e eon by one of his inferior wivee. It **wae** the custom at that time to kill all sons **born** to the Raja by any of hie minor **wivee.** Thh in iteelf is a suficiently **unplmmnt** pnotiae, but a pm~d of the histo y of Manipur ahom that **amonget**

This man wee a cripple, and, so sensible wee he of the disabilities caused by this infirmity, that he invited his brother Jaie Singh or Bhaggo Chandra to wist him in the adminishtion of the country. 

Burmeme Guru Sham died in 1764, end Manipur then passed I **nverion** in 1799. 

through a very **dark** period of ite history. A year before the death of the orippled chief, the Burmese defeated the M8nipuri foms and advanced **into** the valley. 

Though they only mupied it for a few days they were guilty of terrible atrocities, and carried away with them a great quantity of slaves. The Manipuris, feeling themelves **too** weak to oppo~le their national enorny unassisted, made overturen to the British. A small force under Oaptain Verelst was sent to their assistance in 1768, but the difficulties of transport proved insuperable, and it got no further than Cachar. 

About 1765, the **Burmese** were again upon the move. Jaie **178~1788, in** h R a **buf** The lldsnipurb met them at Tammu in the Kubo Valle y but **vdn** from the Btate were defeated ; the enemy entered the vslley; **and** Jaie singh compelled to **fly** t.41 **ca~har** and **from** thbnce into Assam. The Br~meee placed s prince ded Kelembs on the throne, but it was not for long that he enjoyed the sweets of power. In 1768, Jaie **Singh** returned **from** 
Assam, Kelemba fled to Burma, and, when in the following year he returned m the hope of being able to regain the *qadi,* he was killed by two Manipuris who gained access to his person by professing to be bearers of a message from Jaie Singh. But, though he died, he did not die unavenged. In the following year his 8bmthers entered the valley, **and Jaie** Singh **was** compelled to take refuge in Cachar. The mieersble little State was then ,given up to anarchy **and** confusion, one pretender following another in quick sucoession on the throne, some of them being Manipuris and eome Burmese. 

After a time a Manipuri prince, by **name** Erembct, eucceed~d in introducing some form of settled government ant1 some **clegree** of order, and in the third year of hie reign actually repulsed the Burmese who were engaged in one of their periodical invasions of the valley. On hearing of this most unusual succese, Jaie Singh once more retnrned and took up the reins of Government which Eremba reaiped with a humility which seems stnrngely rinnatnral in a Manipuri prince. In the following year the Burmese **again** invaded Manipur, Jaie Singh **again** 
~oiight safety in flight, and the State **was** once more handed over to all the mieeriee of mimle'and anarohy. 

After a time Jam Sinuh once **more** enccceeded in retnrning and **establishing himaelf upon** the throne. But he WM now beoomi~g an old man, and such dignity **u d** 
attached to the position of Raja of tbm petty Bbte nu herdlr sufficient to compensate for **tl~c** terrible uncertainties of the position. Three times **had be** been driven from his throne, and in hie declining years he seems t.o have longed lor a less st,renuous and eventful life.

Yufit 
:ia%s" For seven years Manipur enjoyed a period of tranquility to which for long the people had been unaccustomed. -Mar-jit avenged himself for the loss of his pony by invading hachar and dividing most of that fertile district between his two brothers Charjit, to whom he had now been reconciled, and Gambhir Singh.* Blit in 1819, Marjit somewhat foolishly attempted to assert his independence of the Burmese, and when called upon to attend the court as a feudatory of the king, declinod to do so. It **maa** not to be supposed that the Bllrmese would quietly swallow theafFront that had been putllpon them. An army marched info Manipur, Marjit WRS compc;lled to fly, **and** the Burmese remained in occnprttion of the country.

In 1828, the Burmese advanced across the hills into Cachar. They were now operating at a considerable distance from their base, and they were defeated and dnven back by Gambhir Ringh, who had tagen np a strongpo~ition in the Burma Valley.

Nur Singh wan succeeded by his brother Debendra Singh, who enjoyed a troubled reign of three months' duration. The three sons of Nur Singh at once retired to Cachar, and brought back Chandra Kirti Singh, the son of **Uambhir** Singh, for whom Nur Singh had acted as regent for ten years.

Debendra Singh then made two attempts to recover his lost throne, but neither of them were succeseful. In 1861, hie son combined with two of Nur Singh's aons to try **and** wrest the scoptre from the hja, but the conspirators were defeated and Debendraps eon wm killed **Hope** apringa, however, eternal in the bi.nipori breast, and in i.110 **folloairg yeax** the aons of two **ot3her** Manipari Rajas, **Mad11** Cbnnndm and Mrrrjit, made an sttompt, which was as llsual imsooceeeful. 

For seven pars there was a 'cessation of theso raid^, 
but in **1859,** one Mvpsk, a descendant from the original Gharib Nawa~, tried his luck and failed. In 1862, he made a second attempt, equnliy unsuccessful, and was wonnded and made prisoner. Tn 1864, Kana.i Singh, Marjit's son, made a second bid for the crown, but again without success, and in 1866, Gokul Singh, a younger son of Debendra Singh, headed a raid from Cachar. On this occaaion an incident occurred which Tvns quite in keeping with the llsllal proceedings of this little State ; 
proceedings which would Reem ~llmost too grotesquely foolish even for burlesque, if the results were not so tragic for the principal performers in the drama. The Raja's men moved out to meetlthe raiders, and towards evening entrenched themselves in the position they had taken **up.** In the meanwhile a party of sepoys, who had been sent from Cachar in pursnit of Gokul Singh, came up, and, finding a number of Manipurio holding a position, jumped to the conclusion **th~t** these were tl~e raiders led by **Gokul** qingh. **The** same idea occnrred to thc Manipllri troops, who were not aware that nng sepoyfi

Much of the tronble of that troublous time mas due to the treachery of the Manipuri princes, a treachery which did not even spare rt brother or a father. But macli **was** due to the Burmese, and for their invasions the Manipuris mere only partially responsible; though, had they not been so hopelessly divided, they mould probably have succeeded in repelling the attacks tlirtt were made upon the valley. But after the appointment of a Political Agent in 1885, they were practicaliy guaranteed against invasion from without, and the troubles that beset them mere all of their own making. Even tshe President of a South American Republic, even a. political leader in the Balkan States, mould turn with disgust from such a solry record, such a pitif nl tale of political incapacity and intrigue. In tlie short space of 82 years, between 1884 and 1866, no less than thirteen attempts were made upon the throne by filibustering adventurers from Cachar, and **there** mere no less than two attempts at revolution from within. Exccpt in the case of the one raid **which** ma9 
~ucce,ssEul, and which placed Chantlra Kirti Singh **up"** 
the throne, it can hardly be said that any of the yrctenclen had .the smallest claim to ol~st tl~! chicf wlro **hap** 
pened to be in possession at tlie timc. Rajas of Manipur have many sons, the right of primogeniture is but imperfectlp wk nowleged, and any descendant of the ruling house who felt that he had the very smallest prospect of success, did not hesitete to make a11 atempt upon the gadi. 

8ur~~~~~~ Ilnyh, **113136.** In May 1886, Chnndrs Kirti Singh died **and was** 
succeeded by his eldest son Sur Clinndrs Yingh. Aa usual, at.tempb were mde by other pretenders to drive him from the throne. Bara Chaube Singh, the eldest son of **Nur** Singh, headed s rising which noarly proved successful, but was ultimatety defeated and compelled to fly. In Octobor 1886, he started from CacEar with a force of 300 men, but was followed by Lieutenant Harris with 100 military police. Bara Chauba took up his position on a small hill about three miles from Imphal, but was defeated without difficulty and snrrenderod. He and his relatives were deported to Eazaribagh, and those of his followers who mere British subjects were sentenced by the Deputy Commissioner of Cachar to various terms of imprisonment for waging war upon a friendly State. 

In **M87,** two more attempts were made, both of which occurred in the month of September. The first mas headed by the *wungkhai~apda,* or chief judicial officer of the State. It mas quelled without difficulty by the Manipuri troops; and the leader **waa** shot dead when making a rush upon the Raja's private residence. The second was headed by Jogendre Singh, the son of a man called Chibib, who bad been killed when heading a revolt against, Nur Singh some 40 years before. The insurgents, about 200 in number, entered the State from Cacl-iar, hotly pursued by a detachment of tho military police. Thuy were met by a company of the Mth Gurkha Light Infantry 
(now Eth Gurkha Rifles) under Lieutenant **Row,** and Jogendra Singh and 14 of his followers were killed, while 38 were taken pri~oner. 

Tho revolution that took place in 1890 was success- **a~r~b~dn** 
Bin hexful, and Bur Chandm Singh **wse** driven from his palace **pgk** L. 

by his two youngest brothers. They were instigated to this act of treachery by tb third brother Tekondrajit, 4 the *smapati* or chief **military** officer jn the Stste. 

The deposed Raja took refuge in the residenoy, **and** 
there formally resigned the orom, announcing the fact of his abdication in a letter to the **senapati,** and returning to the palace the silver sword of state. He then withdrew to that home of lost Manipuri causa-, Cachar. Brit as soon as he reached ~ritisi territory he repudiated his deed of abdication and applied to the Government for assistance in tlie recovery of the throne. 

ao be nap at^ Such a. proposal did not commend itself to the ordered. Government of India. They decided to recopise as Raja the second brother Kula Chandm **Dliaja** Singh, who, on the flight of Sur Ch~ndra, had proclaimed his accession to the *qadi;* but directed that the turbulent *senapati* who had been the leading spirit in the recent rerol~~tion, sltould be deported from the State. The *senapati* wae, however, very popular with the Mmippris, and this mas probably the principal cause of the determinod opposition offered to his **me&.** To carry out these order? the **Chief** ~omrnissione;, with an eecort of 400 sepoys of the 42nd and /blth G~irkhe Rifles (now the 6th and 8th) under the command of Lieutenant-Coloael Skene, proceedud to Ifanipur, **and** arrived at Imphal on March **22nd.** He was received with every shorn of ootmrd respect, but it **was** a ~igai6cant fact that the salntt: wae fired from within the Fort, ad that the **gun8** 
were not as **mual** brought out to the polo ground. A 
durbm **waa** announced for noon on the same day, but though Kllllr Chendra presented himself at tlie residency. 

tho *senupti* gent hie excuses and gt,ated that 110 was **too** 
i!l fo **oome.** The Chief Commieoioner deciined to hold a durb~r in the absence of the senapati, snd, as the **Raja** 
was unable to procure his attendance, he ws allowed to leave. In the afterno03 the Political Agent visited the palace, and informed the Raja that the durbar would be held at 9 **A.M. 03** the following day, **Ymh** 23rd. The day and the hour came, but neither the Raja nor the sauzpati appeared. An liltimatum was then sent to the palace to the effect that if the senapati was not given up without more ado, steps would be taken to Lave seized bg force. The Political Agent also spent some hours in consultation with the Raja, and endeavoured **fc,** 
induce him lo comply with the demands of Govomment, but without effect. 

Shortly before daybreak on March 24th, two parties me fighttine on Meroh of men were sent to arrest the *sempati* in his house, which was situated about a quarter of a mile away to the north-cast, just outside the strong wall which encircled the precincts of the palace. The first party, under the Command of Lieutenant Brackenbury, approached tlic house from tlic east. They appear ta have advanced too far, and Lieutenant Brackenbury **was** mortally wounded. llL1e Rlnnipuris lining the inner wall of the palace then opened fire from the south, and the sepoys, assailed as they mere in front and on the flank, fell **back.** In the meanwhile, the second party under Captain Butcher had succeeded in capturing the house, but the *senctynti* had flown, and they merely continued to hold the house **and**

&ed; but in the afternoon tb troops were withdrawn from these two advanced positions, and concentrated in the residency. The Manipuris had been firing on this building during the afternoon, but the bombardment seems to have done comparatively little damage. In the evening the cease fire WM sounded, and the Chief Commissioner at tempted to enter in to negotiations with the enemy. The correspondence proved abortive, but a message was shortly afterwards received to the effect that the *se~ucputi* was anxious to confer with Mr. 

Quinton somewhere between the residency and the main gate of the fort. The Chief Commissioner moved away down the **road** attended or followed by the Political Agent Mr. Grimwood, Lieutenant-Colonel Skene, Lieutenant Simpson, and the Private Secretary, Mr. Cossins. 

The party advanced further and further down the road, till at last they could dimly be descried through the gathering darknees standing in front of the main gate. Then they disappeared, and were never seen again alive by European eyes. The officers remaining in the reeidency continued to look down the road striving to catch s glimpse of **tlm** ret~~rning party. As time went on thoir anxiety grew apace, but thev hesitated to take **any** decisive action for fear lest they might in some my prejudice the **coureo** of the negotiations. Aboal; midnight a voice called from the fort in Manipuri, " **the** 
ChieE Commieeioner will not return," and immediately affemrde the Manipuris began once more to open **fire** 
upon the residency. It **W80** then decided by the officers who had ssenmed **coxnand** in €he abeence of Colonel Bkme, to retire **towarb Owhar,** and no time was lost in giving dect to tbie dedan. 

From the accollnts given, by thc natives who mere **Chief fitof corn- th6** 
mwioner present, it appears tliat the British oflicers had a meet- **end h~ oompenions.** ing with tlie *senoputi* and other ministers outside the - 
durbar hall. No conclusion had been arrived at, and the officers hncl started to return, whell they mere hemmed in by a menacing and angry crowd. The ministers requested them to re-enter the durbar hall, as they were doubtfltl whether they could restrain the mob, but, as they mere going there, Mr. Grimmood re~eivcd a mortal wound from 9 spear, and Lieutenant Simpson, who immediatelp attacked the murderer, was slashed across the head with a dao. It is doubtful whether this attack was premeditated, and whether at the time when the Chief Commissioner was asked to enter the fort, the senrzpati had **any** treacherous designs upon his life. But by a curious process of reasoning they seem to have considered that, now that one of the five had been murderously assaulted, there was nothing to be gained by abstaining from f urtber treachery. The officers weye detained for some time in the durbar hall, an insignificant building of lath and plaister containing several rooms, and resembling a small bungalow more than a hall of audience. They were then brought out bound, thrown on the ground in front of the two dragons that stood before the palace wall, and beheaded in the Romewhat barbarous M~nipuri fashion. 

Outaide Imphal s wanton and unprovoked attack &y$;&fle.

Melville. That unfortunate gentleman **left** &nipur on **Marqh** 28rd, and proceeded by eaay **stagw** tow^^& 
Kohimq .s he **waa** not awhre tht them rn my risk of disturbances occurring. On Mamh 26th, he was at Maiangkang, about 83 miles from Impbal, and there discovered that he mas unable to communicate by wire either with Manipur or Kohima. In the afternoon b pmty of Manipuris rode into the post,.but as there woe a Mnaipuri thana at the place there **was** nothing in this incident to arouse suspicion. Mr. Melville was a cripple, he was only acmmpanied by a Eurasian signaller and his servants, and, ignorant as he mas of any cause for treachery, he **was** entirely unprepared. Even so the Mrtnipurie did not venture to attack him openly, but summoned the **Ragas** from a neighbouring village, and waited for the night to come and hide their movemente. 

They then began shoutiilg and creating a disturbance outside the rest-house, and when the signaller came out to learn the rneani2g of this demonstration, they fired a volley which sti-etched him mortally wounded in the verandah. Mr. Melville and his servants escaped out by the back and gropcil their way up H, deep ditch, but lbme as ho mas, the ~l~~fortun:~tc gcnlemlzn could not go far.

The following account **of the eteps** taken to reduce **Bertomtion** 
of crder in mnipur. 

the reb1.a is reproduced from the account given in the Report of the Political Agent for **1891-92** :- 
" As soon, however, as the news os the disaster was brpught to Kohima by fugitive sepoya and others, the Deputy Commissioner at ouce marched on Mao, and drove back some Manipuri forces. On the Cach .r Bide troops were moved to the Barak river, measures mere taken to occupy the Manipur capital by British troope. Three columns marched on Manipur from Kohime, Silchar, and Tammu, and arrived before the palace on the morning of the 27th April, to find that the Regent and his brother **had** 
teaken to flight on the previous evening towards the Tankul Hills, ;,nd the leading Manipuris were in hiding in the valley. The palace had been looted by the villagers, the arsenal waa destroyed, and the capital completely ewuatod. A detachment of Mouzlted Infantry were quickly sent in pursuit of the fugitives, who were followed up into the Tankul Hills, where further pursuit was abandoned owing to the peths being impweable for ponies. Foot soldiers then took up the chase, but without success ; in the meenwhile some Kukis, who were armed by me, headed the princes and compelled them to return to the valley, where ono by one they were captured by Manipuxh in my employ, the Senapati being the last to be arrested on the 23rd May. 

Hearing of the dieeeter at Manipur, the Jemadar in Command of the Military detachment of SO sepoys, .43rd Gurkha Rifles, at Langthabal, the British cantonment three miles fo the uouth of the ca ital, withdrew his detaohmont in ood order to Tammu. Here 1 e met the gallant lieutenant (now%ajor) Grant, who, on hearing the news, at once marched on Manipur, taking with him the Jemadar's detachment, in addition to 50 men of his own regiment, tho 12th Regiment **(2r.d** Burma Battalion), Medres Infantry. At Thobal, 14 miles from Menipur, Lieutenant Grant's force wee met by the Uanipuri troops, who, however, failed to dislodge him from the ~osition he had taken up at one end of the village. He was, however, unable to advance, and **WIM** recalled to Temmu, which ho succeeded in reaching without lose. A Penjabi trader at Langthrrbel, named Hafiz Fateh Shah, gave much asaietance to the detachment rstiring on Temmn, and agein to Lieutenant Grant on his dvance on Menipur. For hie loyalty end brevery on these occeeions, he has been rewarded hy R money payment of Ra. **100,12** plough cattle and a grant of 20 acrea of land in Menipur rent free for life. He **has** also been given the title of "Lion hearted." 
The only serious opposition to the march on Manipur was met by the Burma column near Palel, where.some 300 of the enemy had encamped in a small earthwork. Of this numbel; 200 unwisely permitted themeelves to be aurronnded, and in the fight that ensued 193 were killed, our loss being one native officer killed aid three British officers, one native officer, and one sepoy wounded. On arrival at Manipnr the bodies of our officers and inen were interred in the Residency cemetery ; and the surplus troops shortly afterwards returned to India and Hnrma. The summer garrison retained in the valley ,comprised 8th JIountain Battery, I-2nd Gurkha Riiles, 43rd Gurkha Rifles, 44th Gurkha Rifles. In October the 1-2nd Gurkha Rifles returned to India, and in the following month the Mountain Battery marched to Burma. The 44th Gurkha Rifles on being relieved by a wing of the 42nd Gurkha Rifles from Kohima returned to Shillong, and the permanent garrison in Manipur now consists of the 43rd Gurkha Rifles and the wing of the 42nd Gurkha Rifles." 
Pnnirhment of the **guilty.** 
In the meanwhile those principally responeible for the mllrder of the British officers were placed upon their trial. Kula Chandrlz, the acting **Raja,** Tekendrajit the senapuli, and Angao Singh the third brother were brought before a special commission, which sentenced the senapati to death .~nd the other two to transportation for life. 

The Tankul general, one of the most duential persons in the State, Niranjm Subadsr, an ex-sepoy of the 841th Native Infantry, and **Kajjrto** Manipuri, tbe actual murderer of Mr. Grimwood, were **ell** sentenced to death by the Political Agont. Gallows were erected on the polo ground, and the sentences duly carried out. b **far** as the eye could see the plain **wae white with** woman.

As the drop fell and the **um-** 
_pati and Tankul general were ' launched into eterpity, a deep groan went up from the aesembled throng. 

The Government of India declared that the Mani- . ~egr-t of IKenigpur State was forfeit to the crown, but decided in their **eteU.** 
clemency to regrant it to a scion of a junior branch.. 

Thejr choice fell upon Chura Chand, the youngest of fivs brothers who were the great grandsons of Nur Singh through his fifth son Bhogendra. It has been already shown that Nur Singh, like Gambhir Singh (the father of Sur Chandra Kirti Singh), was a great-grandmn of Gharib Nawaz, but he traced his descent through a younger son. The people, it, is said, received the news with some surprise and disappointment. The common folk were in favour of annexation, and could not understand w y, if the 9 State **was** to be regrsnted, a boy should be eelected, who, if nominallj of royal de~t, belonged to a family whose circumstances and eurronndinp were of the hnmb1eet.t Since 1891, the affaiae of the State have been adminisbr6d by the Political Agent **4nring** the minority of the Raja, and varioua reforms, which will be de&ribect in the following chapters, have been initiated.

A Political Agent was first appointed in 1886, when the European officer deputpd to supervi~e the Manipur levy was withdrawn. He was posted in the valley "for the premstion of a, friendly intercourse and as a medium of oommunication with the Manipur Governmenti, end, as **ocaui011** may require, with the Burmese authoritiee on that frontier, **and** more especially to prevent border fends, which might lead to hostilities between the Manipnria **and** the Burmese." * In 1870, his duties mere further dehed by Government, and were said to consist primarily in insisting upon a strict fulfilment of the duties which theeRaja is bound by treaty to perform, and in brin,oing hia influence gently and gradually to bear upon the **Raja** for the reform of abuses in his internal administration.? 

="rat In 1861, the Civil Finance Commission under the AS--- presidency of Sir Richard Temple proposed that the Political Agency st Manipur should be abolished. The propd did not commend itself to the Government of **Indim,** axid it is said -that the mere rumour of impding change ww productive of,ill effects in **Msnipur.**

enslaved, and the people of one village under the protection of the Agent were ordered to pay Rs. **1,600** to realize **which** they had to sell their families: " On the removal of Dr. Dillon in **1863,** the question of the retention of the Political Agent was a&in raised, and in February 1864, the Raja himself asked that an officer might be posted in the valley. It was finally decided to accede to his request, for reasons which were set forth as follows in the orders of the Govenment of India. "The past history of the country shows that bo Chief has been able to manage the peoplG: they have one and all proved cruel, oppressive, and weak. The country has been the scene n$ *<:...:I* -- 
vr **blvu** ware,-inurders, devastation, and misery under the nominal control of the C,hiefa ; while as a rule, peace, order, and comparative prosperity reigned while a British Agent was present. Lastly, but not least, both thechief himself and his people desire to have a British Agent amongst them ; they have told_&ptain Stewart 'that the presence of one is equal to a brigade as regards the security of the country.+" 
The Raja seems to have been anxious enough to re- **a~~tue** 
attltude of wive a representative of the Government at his court, EtSp-
Politioel but the treatment accorded to him when he came wa3 **agent.** often far from satisfactory. In 1862, Dr. Dillon was appointed Agent, and in the following year the Raja submitted to the Government of India a document in which he formulated s number of serious **charges** against their rrpresentstiva No detailed enquiry was made

info these **chargee,** aa on other grounds the Governor Oeneral in Council yes of opinion that Dr. Dillon had shewn that he waa not qualified for the appointment which he held. Ten years later, charges were brought again st the Officiating Political Agent, Colonel Tbomson, which were found by the Government of India to be entirely fdse. Again in 1876, comilaints were made to the **chief** 
Commissioner againat the Political Agent Dr. Brown. Colonel Kestinge warned the Raja that charges of this nature ~hould not be lightly made against the representative of Government accredited to his court, but the Chief replied that L had satisfied himself by a strict examination that they were true. Orders were %cording]~. issued for an onquiry to be held in Manipur, **and** 
the conduct of the proceedings was entrusted to Colonel Sherer, **t.ho** Deputy Commiseioner of Darrang. Dr. Brown was too ill to attend dliring the proceedings, and **died** 
the day before their termiliatlon,* but he handed in a written ~tatement and uamed the witnesses he wished to call on his behalf. On Colonel Sherer's report the Government of India remarked that there could be little doubt that much of what was alleged against **I)-.** Brown wss untrue, trivial, and childieh. They desired, however, that hrther evideGce should he taken with regard to the 19th charge, non-payment of coolies; and Captam Dumnd, who had been appointed to officiate as Political Agent, was entrusted with the enquiry.

come to by this officer was that the charges brought - 
against Dr. Brown were the result of a deliberate conspiracy. The Raja and all the principal officers of the StRte were implicated, and evidence more or less false had been given throughout. A severe reproof **wai** in - 
consequence transmitted from the Government of India to the Raja. 

The following account is given by Captain Durand **~y~~~~;,,** 
of the position of the Political Agent : of **t%e** 
Politiod Aeent. - 
"The Political Agent is dependent on the will an'd pleasuro of the Maharaja for everything. Hi3 every word and movement are known to the blahareja. He ie in fact a British officer under Uanipur snrveilla~~cs. If the Mahareja is not pleased with the Political dgent he cannot get ailythi~lg-he is ostracised; from bad coarse black atta whicll the Maharaja sells him as a favour, to the dhobi who washes **Iliu** clothes, and the Nagas who work in his garden ; he cannot purchase anything at any price. The court is almost openly hostile, though they have pliancy enough to pretelid to g great regard for the Politick1 Agent and the Sirkar." * 
But it was not only in his attitude towards the Yoli- **Menipur** 
tical Agent that the conduct of Chandra Kirti Singh was **Fst22d** 
not above suspicion. In **1860,** it became clear that demerortion of frontier. 

&nipur was **giving** assistance to the Angami Nagas who were at that time a serious source of embarrassment to the Administration. Such conduct elicited a severe reproof from the Imperial Government,, and for a time aft any **rate** there waa eome improvement. In **1872-58,** the Raja again adopted a most unseemly attitude, when eteps were being &ken for the demarcation of the boundary betweon Manipur and the Nsga Hills. Every obstruction p~siblo **was** offered, and the Raja even **had** 
A- 
the effrontery to expressly "forbid " the Politics1 Agent fo enter the eastern portion of his territoriee. The Maharaja was sternly called to account by the Supreme Government, and was required to submit an ample apology for his improper conduct. 

BU~ **ir of** On the other hand, the attitude of the Raja during urirtanoe in 
~d=~~~t the mutiny wss quite correct, and he was of material uads. assistance in the Luahai expedition of **1871-72.** Again in 1879, it was tho timely appearance of Colonel Johnstone with the Mamipuri troops which saved the garris~n of Kohima from disaster. It must, however, be borne in mind that the Manipuris had no grounds for entertsinin&: any feelings other than those of friendliness towards the British Government. It was to this Government that they owed their deliverance from Burma, their hereditbry enemy. It was this- Govornment that had strengthened their hands and so enabled them to subdue the hill tribes that surround the valley. On the north they were reetrained from proceeding too far again~the Angami Nagas, but activity in this quarter was likely to have few practical results. The varioue Political Agenta seem to have been all agreed in condemning the natire form of Government **as very bd,** but this is 3 question which it is hardly necessary to elaborate in a Gazetteer.* There was very little interference with the internal administratiou of the State, and the practical result of the connection of the British Government with Manipur was merely to guarantee it frob invmion **from** 
without.

an excellent example of the necessity that **exista** for **goyk**

severity. So firm mas their rule that by some it **wee** 
thought that the leopard **had** mtudy changed its **spota,** 
and that Nagas and Kukis had lost .even the potentislities of violonce. Lieutenant Dun, in 1882, declared that the **Tanknls** were thoroughly eubject to the Bfanipurir and were "not in the least aariike." As **twon** as tlic Mstnipuri sopoys mere withdrawn in 1891, this tribe rcvcl*te(I to tho customs of its rtnccstors, and decided **six** 
loug~tanding disputes in its own wny. **Two** of them were sottled without actual hornicidc?, hut **tlic** remaining four cost altogether 80 lives. In the morth-we~t **corner** of the State the **Kukis** raided the Kabui **Nagrr** village of **Atteng** and killed fifty-two persons, losing two of their own men in doing so. They also acted in a peculiarly troechorou~ mannor **towards** the Nagss of the Makui village noar;Kaitornabi. - Them **Nagaa** wore in **charge** of 8 **state** pnary, and, on their refusing to supply the Kukis with some of the dhan, three of them were attacked and killed. The Kukis expressed regret for thie occurrence, and in order to re-establish good relationa invited the Nagas to a feast,, at which they yroposed to re-cement the bonds of friendship. The Nagas were weak enough to trust these sctvages, with the result that helf-way through the meal the Kukis suddenly turned upon their guests and murdered seventeen ! In addition to these more or lesr wholesal'e operations, seven persone were at various times murdered by Nagas on the Kohima-Manipur road, so that traxelling in this portion of the Stete was a thing not wholly devoid of interest and excitement. 

In the following year affairs were fairly quiet, and only seven murders were reported from the hills, though one of theee murders was fraught with serious consequences. A Kuki, by name Toki, was of opinion that the Naga village of Swemi had stolen somo of his paddy. 

When he went to complain, Swemi, far from giving satisfaction, killed the Naga he had taken with him to act as an interpreter. This occurred in December, 1892, and at firet the Kukia seemed to take the matter fairly quietly. 

But all the while they were taking stock of their resources, and preparing a vengeance which, if long delayed, wse completle and thorough when it came. Four months later thoy fell upon the doomed village in the gmy light of the early morning when the people were etill **deeping** in their honeee. **Tskon** unawares they could not fight, and there wae no time to **fly** ; and when the **evengem** of the murdered iqterpreter and the etolen grain had finiahed their grim work, they found tbat they had accounted far 286 of the offending villagers, 187 of whom were women and children. This raid was suitably punished ; the hillmen then began to settle down once more, and during the last ten years have given comparatively little trouble.

D~ZU~W. THE **Manipur** State covers an area of 8,466 square milea and in **1901** had a population of 284,465, so that the density of the country ae a whole is only 84 to the square mile. The greater part of **the** State consists, however, of hills, which can only support a sparee and scattered popnlation, ~nd inthese mountain rangee there **are** only aome 12 persona to the square mile. The ma of the valley is not accurately known, but is probably about six hn~~drcd square miles. Here the deneity ie a great deal higher, anti ie probably not less than 320 to the aquarc mile, R **figuru which** is considerably in excese of the **late** recorded for **any** of the plains districts in the Provinco with the solitary exception of 8ylhet. 

Imphal tore Manipur contain8 one town, **Imphal,** and **1,409** villagee, 896 of which are eitueted in the hills. Imphal is, however, hardly a town in the sense in which that word is generally understood The site of the pat (the fortified encloeure in which s prior ta 1881 the **Raja's** pahoe atoocl) md a block of **land** to the hest, havo been uomtituted a resenre on which the Manipurie &re not allowed to settle. Within the earthen ramparts of the pat are fine lines for the accommod~tion of eight companies of native troops, the military police hospital, the mew, and the bungalows of the regimental officers. All of these buildinge are of red brick roofed with tilee, and the officerss houhs recall the villaa near ~aidenhead or Borne other rivex%ide0 resort more than the ordinary bungalow of the **Indian** plains. Weet of the pat is the residence of %he **Politicel** Agent, and further back, beyond the dfternoon baa* and the polo ground, is a row of kaiyse' shops, with the &niPxiri court houses and the school close by. The rest of the town ie uothing more than one huge **viiage.** The houses stand in Bpacious compounds, and are **dff** ectudy - hidden from the road by the ecreen of *ikra* which grows from the mud walls surrounding them. There are no shbps, and the place ie ~bmlutely devoid of **any** urban featuree. Imphsl is in fact, nothing more tb a cantonment situated at the northern end of an enormous village. In addition to the military lhee the public buildings include the re& 
denoy, the offices of **&he** Political Agent **and the** Superintendent of the **State,** a post and a telegraph **ofice,** 
and r few emaller bungalom **cwupied** by the **Raja's** 
tubr, the Assistant to the Political Agent, and the 8t.b **Engineer.** The conthl part of the **town** is well lighM with ~tylene ga~, far better lighted id fact 3h.n **nny** other town in A~~EIII. Acetylene **gas,** though an exdent illuminating medium, is by no means oheep. 

Kernsin6 oil lamp were first tried, but so much oil was stolen from the lamps that it waa foundthat the metylene lamp, which wtle not exposed to depredations of the nature, was positively cheapsr. There are seven protected tgnks in the town from whioh the water is pumped and distributed through ' pipes to various localitiee. 

The Manipuri professes to be unable to drink this pipe water, but his scruples appear to be quickly dieappearing. In ewh house there is a filthy pond **into** which is drained **all** the surface water from the compound, little ohannels **being** aspecially cut to facilitate the process. 

Here the Manipuri washes his clothes and perbon, and then draws his drinking-water. The rivers are full of water in the rains, but h the dry akon shrink to shallow muddy atreams creeping languidly along at the bottom o£ thk* beda I'he bsnh are high and steep, and st thh eeaeon of the yeer their cmts **are** fully twenty feet above the level of the **water.** The **mads** in the **tiown**

They are, however, much more clearly defined units than the **~1illag08** of the Burma Valley. In Bylhet the bunb~ 
grovm **mem to** atretah for miles. Villagee end barnlet0 melt impemeptibly into one another, and it is often difficult to say where one begins and another en&. There is none of thie uncertainty in Mnnipur. The village is set down fair and square in the middle of the rice fields tilled by its inhabitants, and it is sometimes several miles or more to its nearest neighbour. The houses have larger gardens than is usual in Assam, and the ground around the homeste~~d isoften sown with mustard. This garden is surrounded with a stout mud wall, and the place is frtirly free from jungle. In Assam the cottages of the villagers are hemmed in by a thick wall of bamboos, plantaim, **am-** palms, and other trees, which effectually exclude all-light and air. The ground even in the winter time is hmp, and wide-leaved arum cover the soil and add to the general humidity. This is not the case in Manipur. There are comparatively few bamboos or plantains, there are no areca palms, for they will not grow in this upland valley, and there is little jungle. The homeetead is exposed to the purifying influences of the sun and sir, and is a much healthier place to live in than the dmrmp, dark cottages of the Aaeamese, In the hill8 the villages are generally built on a bare spot near the snmmit of a ridge. The house8 Ere placed in proximity to one another and there are no gardens, so that a large Naga village almost sttaine the dignity of a little **town.** 
The first ceneue of Manipur was tshn in 1881 and Growth of **population.** 
discloeed a population of 2491,070. In 1891, the census schedules were filled 11p, but the papers were destroyed in the disturbances that occurred soon after, and there is no information available even with regard to the gross population of the State. **In 1801,** the population was 2841,466, which ehowed an increase of **26-61** per cent. in the 29 years. There is practically no immigration, and it is probable that a portion of the increase was due to the greater accuracy of the enumeration carried out under the directian of the Political Agent, the earlier cenous having been taken by the Durbar. A census of Manipur is not entirely free from -&fficulty. After the schedules had been filled up the entriee had to be copied **ill** Bengali on to slips of paper by persons who were acquainted &!I both Manipuri and Bengali, and the number of people who can read **BE:!** write both Manipuri and Bengali ie by no means large. These slips' **had ibii** k be sent to the central census office at Gauhati, but the road st the time when they were despatched wae very bad, and more than five weeks were consumed on the journey from Imphal to Dimapur. 

~irthplwe. Manipur ia most effectually cut off from the outside world, and 99 per ceut. of the people censused there in 1801 had bee; born within ife boundaries. About onethird of the total n~mber of foreigners had come from the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh **ssd** were employed ae cartmen and in other menial capacities. Bengrrl and Nepal together eupplied rather more than another third, and there were a few artimne from the Punjab. 

Detailed figures for immigrants will be found in Table 111. There are 'large coloniee of Manipurie in the Surme Volley, but these people left their country during the troublou~ **timea** in the first half of the 19th century, and in **1901** there were only **8,MB** pereone who had been born in Msnipur, and were living at the time of the censno in British districts of basam.* About one-third of 'thew people were found in the Surma Vdley, one-third i~ the Naga Hills, and one-sixth in the hills inhabited by thelushais. 

The women in Manipur exceed tha men in numbers **8.x.** 
in spite of the preponderance of the male sex a-inongst the immigrant population. This holds good of the three main classes in the community, *i.e.,* the Manipuris, who style themselves Kshattriyas, the Nagas, end the **KUGB.** 
Amongst the Brahmans alone is there a deficiency of women. Few things are more difficult ascertain than the laws which govern the proportions of the sexes, but the preponderance of women in Manipur is apparently due more to a moderately reaeonable death-rate than to an exceptionally large supply of female babies, as under five there is not much difference between the numbem of the sexee. The women of Manipur are shrewd, capable people, who at all stages of their career are allowed the fullest libe'rty. They are not exposed to the rhks of infant marriage,t or mewed up **within** the four web of their houesa, and the comparatively healthy life they lead is no doubt the principal muse of their longevity. The deficiency of Brahman women is no doubt partly due to the fact tbt they sometimes contract alliances with non-
Brahman Manipuris and thus sink to the statue of their husbsoda. ' Brahman men also not unfrequently marry bend them, **but** such a proceeding in their **csRe** entails no **loee of mete.**

In the plains there are three formu or marriage ceremony in vogue. Amongst the upper clssees the preliminariee of the match are arranged by the gusrdians of the contracting parties, who are not allowed fo have much to do with the selection of their future partnem. When the arrangement is complete, the female friende of the bridegroom's family go to the girl'e house with betelnut, sweetmeats, molasses, sugarcane, fruit, curds and light refreshments of this nature. These are dietributed amonget the neighbours of the bride, who are then for the first time formally notified of the propeed alliance. This ceremony is called *Hm'jct bokpuba.* 
Suits for breach'of promise of marriage receive little encouragement in the State, for, though the food provided on thh occaeion coets about twenty rupees, the penalty aeeeesed if the girl declines to comply with her engagements is only half that sum. No allowance ie made for wounded feelings, and, if the boy ie ungallent enough to break off the match, he eecapee scot-free and his fiancee haa to console herself ae beet ehe cap. If all goes well a date ie fixed for the fine1 marriage ceremony, which ie called *Lilmngha,* and which generally takes place from eix monthe to two years after the grl hae attained puberty. In tho afternoon the bridegroom goes to the bride'e house, accompanied by his friends and relativee. Light refreehmente, which are prmided by the father of the bride, are handed round, and a Brshman ie in attendance to perform the marriage ceremony. 

The **txicred** fire of mango wood is lighted, **ghi** ie thrown into it, and the handa of the happy couple are tied together with a whiep of *kzisha* graae, while the priest spronouncee over them the. appropriate **mantras.** The newly-married couple then retire inside the house, and a good deal of friendly chaff goes on amongst their boy and girl acquaintances. In the afternoon the bridegroom goes to his house, and in the evening hia young wife is brought there in a dhuli and duly handed over to him. 

Both families make such presents to the newly-married couple as they can afford, but the obligatory expenses of the ceremony do not generally exceed some thirty or forty rupees. No price is demanded for the-bride, unless she is of . 

royal descent; the priest is content with a cloth and a rupee or two; and a sheet, which does not cost more than five or six annas, is sufficient wage for each of the musicians who have been engaged to attend the feast. 

In caeee where the people are too poor to afford me rimpb formr. 

even thie moderate expenditure, the girl and the young man are taken by their guardians before some shrine, where, in the preeenoe of the idol, the girl is formally made over to her h~mband. But simple and inexpensive though theee forms of marriage are, they are generally dispensed with by the ordinary villager. Boys and girls have plenty of opportunity of meeting one another and falling in love like their brothers and sietere in the west, and after some monthe of courtship the dameel coneents to elope with her young lover. He goee to her how st night with a party .of friends armed with eticke to protect them from a reecue, the girl eteela out after her parents are asleep, and they hurriedly make off to her lover'e house. On the following morning an ambnanador goee from the boy to the girl'e home, and hlIs her father 7 of **all** that has been done. If the match is a, fairly reaeonable one all will now be well, but if the boy is of inferior family the offended parents will decline. to have anything more to do with their misguided daughter. 

Sometimes the young couple go to make their peace. 

thedvea. The old folks will -be sitting in the house eome few nights after the elopement, when suddenly weeping and wailing is heard outside the compound. The noise draws nearer, and at last the errmt daughter and her lover present themselvee before the outraged parents. At first there is no talk of forgiveness, but after a time the mother is won round, and peace ie once more restored within the family. Pour-fifths of the marriagee of Manipur are said to begin with an elope ment. The man while he is courting his bride naturallj makea himself agreeable to her parents. Hg bringe them little preaents, works for them, and makes ' himself genedy usefui about the house and farm. The father of the girl doe* not wish to lose the services if his daughtsr or the attentions of his would-be son-in-law, sqd k~p putting off the marriage from month to month, till the young people are at last compelled to take the matter into their own hands. The marriage tie ie not regarded with much sanctity ,in Manipur and can be diesolved by either aide at will. The father ,keeps the childran, but If there ie an infant still at the breast it is left with the mather till it has been weaned. Adultery in the wife is regarded as a comparstively venial fault. Sometimes the hueband turns her out, and the adulterer, if caught, qoired to pay a penalty of Rs. 50 ; sometimes he merely give0 the woman a good heating end lets . the matter go st that. The marriage cilstorns of the hill tribes are described at length in the monogrsphs b~

: The proportion of afflicted persons is small, and it is possible that owing to the exceptional difficulties which attend the taking of a census in Manipur, the returns were not as accurate as they were elsewhere. There 
.seems, however, to be little doubt tbat infirmities are fail from common in the valley. In 1869 Dr. Brown reported that leprosy and madness were extremely rare, and that eye disease8 and deformities were quite exceptional.

The other six are 'dlied both to Angami Naga and to Kuki. What little is known about the languages of Manipur will be found in Vol. **111,** 
Part I1 of the Linguistic Survey of India by Dr. G. 1 Grierson.

cute. The caste rules of Manipur differ very materially from those in force in Ihe Surma **Valley** or Bengal. At the heed of the community come the Brahmans, who were originally, no doubt, descended from immigrants from the west, though the custam which permits them to interm8rrp with Kshattriya women without losing caste must have by now effected s thorongh fusion of the blood. 

The greet bnlk of the Manipuris call themselves Kshattriya and rear tho sacred thresd, but they do not apparently lay claim to a western origin. At the bottom of the socid ~oale come tlhe Haris who were originally sweepers, though they no longer perform the needful but disgusting functions of their caste.

caste, and are said to be the dsscendanta of 120 Hindu families of different caste4 who were brought into the valley by GharibNawaz in the latter half of the eighteenth century to teach tho indigenous inhabitants of the valley the customs of the Hindus. They intermarried with the people of the country, but aftor s time the Meithei, or original Manipuri race, came to the concluai~n that the new-comers were of inferior stock, and they are now ' 
regarded with a certain measure of contempt. Both parties etyle tihemselves Kshattriyae, and in Manipur internrarry with one another. In the Surma. Valley the dietinction is more rigidly observed, and intermarriage is not generally allowed. According to amother version they are Manipuris who came from Lakhipur in Cachar with a **sulugram** ~alld Rishnn, which is thought to be posuessed of peculiar eanctity.

T~O **~oir.** 'l'he Lois are thus described by Dr. Hrown :-• 
" The Loi is not recognised as a pure Mnilipuri ; they appear to be descendants of the former illhabitnllt~ of Moirclng, one of the origirrel tribes which formerly occupied the valley to the south. They were formerly independent, but were reduced age8 ngo by tho Meitheia : llellce the name Loi or aubdued wlrich wan given them after tlieir subjection.

Other sections **are,** the Phoongnai and Potsungba, who were originally the Raja's slaves, and the Ayokpa and Kei, who are converted Nape. These seem, however, to be mere functional groups, which can intermarry and eat wi,th **one** another, whose very namos will probably be forgotten, now that the lalup system on which they were based hae been aboliehed. The Manipurie are further divided **into** different sections caned Imnak, some of whioh aro debarred from intermarriage with others. 

The whole caste system of Manipur is, however, of comparativoly recent growth, and there has not yet been time for the development of the excrescencee and deformities which, in p1a.c~-like **Bengd,** have completely obscured the intentions of its founders. Even a Naga can become a Kshettriya aud adopt the wred thread, and in the second generation will be accepted a full Hindu, and the religion and caste system ,of the Manipurie i~ thus a curious mixture of laxity and formalism. 

0.~- %me reference muet now be made to thb Rajkumm though they are a caste in the sense in which that word is used in England, and not a caste as Hindus ordinarily understand that term. They are the descendants of the various Rajas of Manipur. Owing to the prevalence of revolutions there were many Rajas in the State, and as each Raja was generally a man of catholic heart, the total number of their descendants is extremely large. Prior to 1891, they were to some extent regarded as a privileged class, but even then many of them had sunk to the positioil of ordinary villagers. At the present day, the ordinary Rajkumar is n man of no influence or dignity, and is often an idle, discontented fellow, who would rather live by his wits than turn his hand to honest work. 

The c~stom with regard to royal marriages is, by the way, the exact converse of that which prevails in Europe, RS the Raja, far from being prohibited from marrying a commoner, is not allowed to marry a Rajk~imari.

A11 this is **fail-** enough but there is another side to the shield. Honour, even the honour that prevsil_s amongst thieves, seems to be absolutely unknown to them. Their hietory is a painful record of feu& in which brother all tou often met hie death at his brother's hands. The patriarchal instinct is non-existent. There is no head of the family or clan round which the other members rally ; *clu,xcun.* pour soi is the motto of all. 

Loyalty seems unknown. When a man is in power his fellowe cringe before him ; deprive him of his office and they spurn him.

It is unnecessary to describe the manners and customs of these hill tribes here, a~ the whole subject is treated at length in the monographs which are now under preparation by Mr. Hodson. The Tankuls or Lahupas occupy the eastern hills. The men shave the hair on either side of the head and let it grow in a short stubble down the centre of the skull like a cock's comb, a curious cuetom which enablee them to be distinguished at a glance from other hillmen. To the nortlr **the** Tankuls carve out the bill sidea inta terraces on which they grow transplanted rice. To the south they follow the ordinary migratory eyetem of cultivation known as jhum. **The** Koirao or Mao-Maram Nagae live in the north-west of the **Stab,** and closely resemble the Angsmi **N.gu, who** adjoin them on the noith. Tbej wear the Angami **kilt and grow** their rice on terraces cut along the side of the bills. The Kapui **Nagas** ooaupy the hills between Cachar and Manipur. Thej eow their rice broadcaet over the hills like most hill tritms, and **ere** d men with no great muscular development. The men part and bruah their hair with a nwtneee quite unu~ual in the ordinary **savage,** and pbhr it **down** with petwe till it shine0 again. The toilet is completed by a Grecim fillet round the head, end the genoral effect ie not unpleasing. Many of those Nagas are handsome men with regular features and Grecian noees, and have very little trace of the Mongo- 
* 
lian in their physiognomy. Their **housea** have practically no walls, the roof, which is of a V shaped pattern, reaching to the ground on either side. The Marings are a am811 tribe who live to tohe south of the Tankul Nagas. They also are *jhum* cultivators, but, as they have comparatively little land, they are compelled to husband their resources. They are unable to shift their fields from year to year, so they cut an elaborate system of drains along the face of the hill, and thue check to some extent the tendency of the rain-water to carry **off** 
the surface soil. Like the **Daflae** they .let their hair grow long and then coil it up into a knot over the forehead. The Aimole are another small Naga clan who live wuth of the Marine. 

ma **KUL~..** The Kukie **live** in the eouthefn hills, and are pushing their villages into .the Kapui county on the west and the Tan knl country on the **east.** They **ere** divided into two section8 " old " and new," and entered Manipnr from the muth, driven on by the peat northward movement of the tribes which lended the Lushaia in thd hills that bear their name. They ew divided **into** different clans called after the chief who mas the original founder. The best known clans amongst the new Kukis are the Thado, Vilnpon, Changaen, Shingml. 

Mangrung, Khlangam, Chungloe, Changput, Haukih, Simrnte, and Kamhau. The old Kuki clane are the Kom, Anal, Namfau, Chim, Koireng, Chohte, Y urum, and **Hiroi.** The **Kukis** ara jhum cultivators 
*d, se h.e been aeen, are the most turbulent of the hill tribes in Manipur. Other minor tribes are the Km and Koireng who oooupy the hills that overhang the valley near Moirmg, **and** the Chirus who live in the hills to the **wwt** and south of the valley. 

Ih 1901,60 per cent. of the population of the **State** ~~~~~. 

described themselves as Hindus, 86 per -Cent. were animietie tribes, and nearly 4 per cent. Muhammadans. The Manipuris, lik6 most new converts, are full of zeal for their religion. Thei are much under the inflvence of their priests, and in every Brahman's house in Imphal town thera'is a neat building used as a shrine for the presiding deity, and an open shed **(mandap)** where the villagers assemble for' **sankir&n,** the songs and hymns which form so large a part in the ritual of .the Vaishnavites. The houses of theee Brahmans can be easily distinguished, as all round the shrine flags of *bite clot) 4 cut into strange devices flutter from tall bamboos. Th profane foot of a ~um~ean must -not enter even tht compound of a Brahman, and, if he so much as stepa on to the verandah of an ordinary villager, the houee will be inetantly abandoned and another erected in its place. The people abstain from liquor and intoxicating drup, and will not touch animal food of any kind. Tho tulsi plant is carefully cultivated in tbe centre of each compound, and .they are most particular with regard to the application of the **tiiok** or mark which is peculiar to the Vaieh-vite~. At the same time they are free from those nnwholeaome ideee with regard to the treatmeit of their womenkind whioh h~ve infected the Hinduism of- 
Bengal, and which are entirely opposed to what is known of the customs of the early Aryans. **Early** 
merriage and the purdah **are** unknown, and the Manipuri women en joy fully as much freedom as their siatem in the hills. The rules of caste **are** also much relaxed. 

If e Manipuri Brahman mamies a woman of a lower caste, their children still'are Brahmans, while, still more wonderful, if a Brahman woman marries beneath her, she simply sinks to the position of her hueband. There is uo prejudice too against the aale of fieh, an occupation which amongst moat Hindus is restricted to the humblest castes, and even Brahman women are not above retailing this article of food in the bazar. On the other hand the Brahmans will not, as a rule, **take** 
-ater drawn by members of any other castes, though an heption is made in favour of e certain family of wellborn ~sh~ttri~aa who act se water-carriers for the Raja Like all good Vaishnavites the plincipal deity whom they adore ie Krishna, who is worshipped under the name of Qobindji. 

ma **new~a** The nomination of the preeent **Raja** tn the throne tha old 
'"."-. gave rise ti6 some ill-feeling amonget the Manipuri Brshmane. The cauees and conseqwncee of thie diapufe were thus deecribed in the sport eubmitted by the Political Agent for the year 1886-86. 

" The dispute taok ita origin. with the nomination of the preeent minor Reja to the Oeddi. He ie a deeceqdmt (greatgrsndaon) of a former Raja of Manipnr, named Nnr Singh, end when he end hie family came into tbe poesegeion of tbe **idol** 
Gobind, **which ie the god of the rei ing Manipor Yrinoe, the** 
family prieete or Brshmene to tbe %ye1 temple, and the former Bmhmane the poet in continuity, with one ehort exception, aince Menipor hietory tekee wont, yere dismissed. The latter became known as *A+ibae,* and the new Brahmane as *Anoubm,* the distinguieling words meaning 
" old " and " new " respectivdy. The Aribas having held office under tho roysl patronage for so many years, were in the groat majority ; and naturally their disciples were in overwhelming numbers, as compared with the followers of the **Anoubas.** Notwithstanding this fact, the Anoubas were in a position to cause much trouble, for, as stated above, they were in possession of the Royal temple and its resident idol Gobind, and by the persons who were for this reason axcluded from the religious observances at the temple, the disappointmsnt was keenly felt. 

Then, again, the Anoubau, who for so many years had been paesive, soon became aggreseive, and every Manipuri village, large or small, throughout the valley was at once supplied with an Anouba Brahman from Imphsl, whose chief aim was to wrest disciples from the opposition camp. Under the ordinary conditions of life, there would seem to be little or no harm in this action, but no better system of log-rolling dispute8 could be invented. Whatever may be the c~se in Hindu communitioe elsewhere, the Brahman priest among the Manipnris is a necee- 
~lity, his services are always in request : at birlhs, marriages, and deathg at certain ages of the children, at feasts and holydays, st laying of foundation-stones, which in Manipnr is the erection of the main posts of the new house, and on many other occasions the priest must attend. Without his presence ell will not be well. Such being the state of society, pert~dispntee on theee important occasions are unseemly, end **cause** extreme irritation. Here family circles ere large, and when the moment orrived for the oell of a Brahman, there **wee** generelly eonhe mhchievous member reedy to oppose the choioe of the priest. 

In e family of elmost all Adbae, i e., the dieoiplee of en An'ba Bmhman, thitl troublesome person would raise the question of inviting an Anouha, and peace and calm were at an end. Until the matter was settled by a competent authority, a marriage had to be postponed, or even a dead body had to wait removal to the fullerel pyre. 

It is eaid that this troublesome **dispute hae at laat been** 
closed There are **sevon** prirlcipal templee in the town Templer. 

of Imphal which **are** ccinsec~ated to Qobindji, Brindaban Chendra, Senamahi, Nityananda, **Bijoy Gobinda,** Ramji, Mthabali, amtl ,Karnakhyn. The fir& two of theee temples **are** hated in the Rajbari, and all, except the laet two, **are** mere temporary etructures made of timber, bamboo, and thatch. ~ahsbdi's temple is a mh masonry building, and is better known for the grove by whioh it ie surrounded, which is inhabited by swarm0 of monkeys who are regularly fed by the presiding priest, and for whom maintenance a monthly allowance of ten maunde of rice ie given by the State. The shrine of Kamakhya is mewly a roof supported on posts above the image. Prior to the disturbances cf 1891 there were seven **mpsonry** temples in the town, but they lost their sanctity during the fighting that took phce, and some of them have been since diverted to secular uses. The principal temple to Gobindji stands opposite to the old palace site, and consists of a square building with a porch supported on masonry pillars. In front of this porch there is an arcade, flanked with a square **tower** on either hand, in which nautches uaed formerly to be held. Another fine temple is the one which was dedicated t~ 
Bnndaban Chandra. It is built in the form of a square tower, and was captured and held by the British tr&ps duFing the fighting that took place in 1891. 

The Muhammadans of Manipur are, according to Brown,* the descendants of ~mmigrants from the Surma Valley who married Manipuri women. Their ranks were further swelled by marriage8 between the female desceuhts of these people and Manipuris, at a time when the views on this subject were not so r~gid as they ere at the pressnt day. Their maulavis are Msnipuns, wllo have been eent to Cachar ti be instructed iri the prinoiples of their faith by manlavis from Hindustan. They are **eaid** to be fairly well acqnainted with the doctrihs of their religiou ; they abstain from pork and bury their dead, **but** 
the rite of circumcision i~ only very imperfectly performed. 

There are no niasonry mosques in the State, **end** foreign Muhammadans in Imphal havela separate maulavi of their own. 

The religion of the hill tribes is,of the usual tinimis- **bn-.** 
tic type. They seem to have vague ideas of a future life, and. attribute the troubles that beset them in their earthly career to the machinations of evil spirits whom theendeavour to propitiate. For a fuller account of this subject reference should be-made to the monopphe or the hill tribes by Mr. Bodson. 

In 1901, there were eight Jaixrs in the State who were other relifiom. 

merchants from Marwar, 145 Buddhists, most of whom were Nepalese, and 96 Christians. In 1894, a mieeionay came to Manipur and was allowed to make **hie** headquarters at Ukrul amongst the T~nkul **Nagas.** The people have not as **ge't** showh any tendency to adopt the new faith, and, according to the census returns, there were only eight Native Christians in Manipur in **1901.** 
The occupa,tions recorded at the last census were ggy* divided into no le~s than 620 different heads, details for which will be found in the second part of the Report on the Census of **1801.** So elaborate a classification is, however, hardly suitable for a Stete lika Mmip~, **and** the figures would not repay detailed examinetion. No leee than 87,604 women were &own as supported by the prepwation bf **cotton** cloth, **kt,** though a vq **brge** 
8 quantity of cotton cloth of different kinds is producod in **Manipnr,** most of these women workers are the wives or daughtere of petty farmers, and nearly all of them ere dependent on the land for their support. There are various other industries in the State which are described in Chapter V, but they are generally followed as a means of ~ivelihood eubsiditiry to atod supplemental to agriculture, and it would-be difficult to ascertain the number of p90ple actually working at these occupation^. In 1901 the people were divided into the following eight main orders : Governmen t,.8,887 or 1 per cent. ; Pasture and agriculture 207,266 or 78 per cent. ; Personal servicas, 1,967 or 0.41 per cent. ; Preparaticn and supply of material subehcee, 62,988 or 22 per cent. ; Commerce, transport and atorage, 2,907 or 1 per cent. ; Professions, 4,882 or 2 per cent.; Unskilled labour, not agricultural, **864,** or 0'8 per cent. ; Means of subsistence independent of oc0upstion, %6 or 0.8 per cent. 

aamcm and 
.m~mmentm. Hockey on horseback is the national game of Manipur. According to one tradition the game was introduced by a **Saja** named Vakungba about 800 years ago, while others my that hockey was first played in the time of **Gharib Nswaz** in the latter half of the 18th century. 

In the -kipuri game there are seven playere on each ei& : there **are** no god post^, an4 a point ie scored whenever the **ba!l** ie hit across the hack **line** of the oppoeing side. Tliewe rrre no rulee againet crossing or fouling, and, were it **not** for the eize of the ponies ueed, seri.:us **accL** 
date **would** be vary common. The polo coatume wneitafe of 8 scanty dhuti well tucked up 00 that the **thighe** 
em **ahmt** bare, while the cslvee are protected by brightly coloured woollen g~itere. The pony's bridle is adorned with big pompons of coloured cotton, and on either bido of the saddle there are great curved shields of lacquered leather. The head of the stick is placed at an obtise angle to the shaft, so that the p!ayeyers u~ually strike the ball while it is at a considersblo distance to the right * or left of the pony. A good Manipuri has an extraordinary command over the ball, and is also a great adept at dribbling. They have, however, very little **idea** of. combination, a~d generally play an entirely selfish game. The Manipuris ride ext-remely light, and the pace which they - 
succeed in knocking out of their tiny little ponies is most remrkable. Other o~~~~oor sports are foot and boat-racing and wrestling which are thus describcd by Dr. Brown.? 

Thie Lamchel is a compeiition between the different, (' Pan- Lvmohel or foot r-8. 

nshe" or classes among the Manipuri population. The Brahmms, as aleo the loweet class of Manipuris, the Lois, nre not ellowed to compete, but Musalmane may. The dishnce run by the competitors is a straight oourae from the brick bridge formerly mentioned to the inside of the RbjeJs enclosure ; the diatence ie under half e mile. The firet of the races consi~ts of triale of epeed by two pannahs at a time : the winners in them recee run again when all have had their trial, and the firet man in of the whola wins the race of the year. The first man receive~ as hie reward sundry presexts, and is excured from ell forced labour or lalloop for the re~t of his life ; he becomee o hanger-on about the Raja usually after his victory. Old. winnere ere ~llowed to run again fcr the honour of tht, thing :when the win rncre than owe, they get presents. The **firat** in at the pn~minary race6 between the I'innehe are allonlrd t1r:eo monthe' exemption from lelloop. These races coum reet competition, alrd for n?ont,h~ before they come off, varioua f enky-looklrlg men, with a ecenby proportion of clothirrg, may be eeen morning end evening trotting along the roade, getting kheuwlvee into trailii~~g for the importa~it event. 

The **Raja** ie alwaye preuent at these end the other games, eeeted in e sort of gateway which bounds the etreight road along which the raceu are run. 

Wm8tlh6. After the races there is an exhibition of wrestling ; this presents nothing very peculiar; the only thing that need be 
~nentio~ied regarding it is (I curious custom that prevails. The viotx over the wrestler who competes with him, before daming to the Raja, leapa up in the air, alighting on his left foot ; 
as he descends he givea his right buttock-a rescnnding slap with his ri ht hand : havin thus asserted hie superior skill he make& 
hie sa 1 eam'in the usua manner. 

Tha Heef rm\# or bo~t The boat races occupy three days in September, and **take** 
-01. place on the moat which surrounda on three sides the Raja's encloeure. This ditch is about 25 or 30 yards broad, and, at the seaRon when the boat races come **off,** colitai~is plenty of water. 

This feetival is tlie most importelit held in IIa~iipur, and great preparet.ions are made for it; stalids are erected on both sides of the moat, the one for the Raja beil~g of coiisidemble size **add** 
height. The wornell occupy stanc!~ on the oppoeite side of the moat. The boats used in the races are twc? in number, one of greet length and hollowed out of a single tree ; the rowere number about 70 men, each with a sliort paddle. Besides the rowers are strvoral me11 attending to the etcerilig, aid ur i~ig 011 the crew. One of these etalids ill the frolit of the boat, an$ leaning on his paddle, encourages the offortv of the men by stampil~g violelitly with his right foot at intervals. The race itself differs from most boat-races ill tlie fact that liere the great object is for the one boat to foul the other and bora it into tlle ballk, so that olle side of tlie boat is disabled, the liieli not being able to use their paddles ; the boats are thus alwaya close together u~itil at the filiisli, wlien the race is usually **wo~** by a foot or two olily : the distal~ce paddlcll is about a quarter of a mile. Each race is rowed twice, whichever wins, and the result8 are carried 011 from year to year. As ill Llie Lumchel, the competitors are men belonging to the different Peniiahs. There are 110 rewarde for the mces, they beilig rowed meroly for the bonoul.of the thing. The Raja in Ilia boat, whicli is like the others, but orlianie~lted with a carved deer'a head aud horns guilt- at the prow, acconipaliies the race ; the **Roje** 011 t,he chief race-day ateerillg I~is own boat. in the dress forlnerly alluded to. McCullocll mentions ill Ilia account that tho boat-race is not a fair raca but a strug le betwce11 the rowers on either eide, in ~vliich tltoao who call cf 081 the hardest blowe are uauelly the victors. 'l'hat fights occesionelly happen is correct, but they arise from accidental causes aird are really not a prsmeditated pert of the performance. While the boats are paddling down to the starting-place, a good deal of chaffing, flinging of .weeds, water, etc., between the rival boats takes place, but all seems to be .?mducted in a good-humoured manner." 
The moat is **now** quite dry, and bost-races can only take place on the river when they are .full of .water in the rains. 

The Manipuriv are fond of cards and chess, but the I gsmer. **ndoor** 
most popular af all indoor **games** is *Kangsanrlha.* The following description of this game and of the great Mauipuri epic is taken from t,ho Account of tohe Valley of Manipur by Major McCuIloch* : -- 
" It is played only in the spring, the players being generally young women and girls, with usually a sprinkling of men on each side. The game seems to cause great excitement, and there is great emulation between the sides. The Kang i~

This i~ placed on the ground upright, at one time with its broad side towards tho party by whom it is to be struok, at another cdgewiae. When the **Kt~r~g** is placsd with its hroad side to the party. 

it is to be pitched et with an ivory disk; when it ie placed edgewise, it is to be struck by the disk propelled on its flat side along the surface of the ground by the force oE tho **lciddlc** 
finger of the right acting off ths forefinger of the left. A good player can propel tho dialr in thie wey with groat forco and prvcision. ll,e side having most hits wins.

The hands are almost invariably carried at the level of the shoulder, **with** bhe fingore pointing upwards. The orchestra consists of one or more **drums** and perhaps a string instruinent or two, and the perforlnera keep time to the music. In one of the nautchee the dresses used are extremely bright and pictureeque. Tliu bodice is of emerald-green satiu covered w it11 eilver sequins. The under-skirt is of scarlet cloth in which small piecee of looking-glase have been inaerted to catch the light, the over-ekirt of a eilvery muelin. The Nagaa too wear bright-ooloured clothe at their dancee, and etmnge ornaments on their he&, 
wl~ile the **men** keep time to the **music** vith **bill-hooks** in their hands. 

The Manipuris burn their dead, but differ from g~~% 
other Hindus in placing thorn in nn open coffin on the tion wlth death. 

funeral pyre. .The *srrtdh* ceremony, as is only natural amongst a **pecyle** who are so conjpletely under the inflnence of their priests, is a very heavy charge upon the next of kin. A *.sankis.lcoi* party is alwhye in attendance, and people occasionally dissipate almost the whole of their property on gifts .to the presiding priests. Ordinary Manipuris, as they claim to bo Kshattriyas, celebrate the **srtadl~** 03 the thirteenth day after the death oconrs.

gf"'t-9: THE staple crop of the valley is rice, which falls **into** 
three main divisions : lingba or transplanted rice ; *dumahi* or high land broadcast rice ; and daotubi ~hich is a form of *ainan.* There are no crop statistics available, but it is thought that about 85 per cent. of the total area under rice ie li~zgba, about 12 lyer cent. dtim.ahi, while the comparatively insignificant remainder is *daobribi.* 
Tizgba or transplanted rice is first sown in little beds or nurseries. The land i~ broken up in April or May, ie ploughed five or **81.x** times till the ground ie reduced to e puddle, and i~ carefully manured with mwdnng and oweayinga. The eize of the rlumerg varies with the area to bo planted out, but generally stande to tbe rice-fields in the propc.~rticjn of 1 to **16.** 
The **eeecl,** which ha8 been selected from the largest **ewe** 
of the provious ye~r's crop, is stettped in water for two or three **deya,** dlowed to germinate, and $hen aown broadcast over the bed in May and June. **It oomea** up rich emerald green, and at the beginning of summer these patches of brightest green herbage are a striking feature in the rural landscape. In the meanwhile **the** 
fields are being got ready for the reception cf the seedling~. The husbandman starts plonghing as soon as the eoil is softened by the spring rain, and repeats the process from four to eight times till be has reduced the land to a rich puddle of mud. After the third ploughing the field is harrowed, and the little embankments, k few inchee high, intended to retain the water are repaired. 

When the seedlings are about seven or eight weeks' old, they are taken from the nursery-bed and carried in **large** 
bundles to the field. Hers they are planted aut in handfuls, each of which contains four or **five** plants. The distance at which these are planted f~om one another depends upon the fertility of the soil, and upon whether the work is done towards the beginning or end of the suason. Transplanting goes on from the beginning of Julj to the middle of August. The **work** is of s most arduoue descriptioa and involve^ stooping for hours in a field of liquid mud, but the Manipuris believe in the principle of co-operation. The bachelors and unmarried girls in the village combine to plant out the different littlo holdings, and with their songs and laughter etrive to turn a tedious duty into an occasion of much fun **aod** merriment. In placea where the water lies **too** 
deep to allow of the plants being properly tnmsplsnted, the aeed is scattered broadcast and sinka to **the bottom** 
and takoa root. Before the end of the rains tha crop is fully gmm, though the nare are **etill** empty ; but about 18 the beginning of October they begin to **fill** and the field to turn to a rich yellow. From the middle of November to the middle of December harvesting is going on. The work is carried out by men and women alike. The plants are cut off close to the earth, and left in the fields for a few days to dry. When they are ready the grain i3 threshed out on a big mat. While the threehing is going on, song are sungs, and prayers are ofiered up ta God begging him to increase the produce of the fielde. 

The grain io then carried home in baskets and stored in large bins made of bamboo mata. The richer men keep their rice in separate granaries, which are raised well above the ground from fear of damp. The straw is t~ot wasted, a~ is usual in **Assam,** but is stacked and used as fodder for the cattle. 

Dumahi and Dwtubt Dv,mcxhi is grown on land which is too ~gh for traneplrtnted paddy. Ploughing begins in May and is repeated **six** or seven timee. The seed is sown broadcast in June, and the crop is harvested in September. 

Yo *ails* are thrown up to retain the water, and very little weeding is done. *Daotubi* is aown broadcast about tho end of June, and ripens about the beginning of December. It is grown in every part of the valley in the low land that surrounds a *bil,* but the total area under this crop is comparatively small. 

Es'%s. The people are fully alive to the advantages of irrigation, **and,** near the foot of the Eille, carry the water of the hill streams to **t,heir** fields. In the lower part of tho valley channels are often **dlig** to bring the water from the rivers on to the land. **Thia** eyetern of irrigation docs not, however, render them independent of the rnipfd, m, if the rivers are low, the water doa not enter t4-0 bnels ; end a dry season in Manipur often means short crop. Floods occaeionally do damage, and the sections df the rivers pessing thraugh ImphJ *panla* are protected by embankments. In 1898, there was a serious flood. No less than 89 inches of rain fell in the two months of May and June ; the river bunds were breached, and the polo ground went several feet under water. Deer and pig also injure the crop, especially in the southern- part of the valley near lthe Loktak, and, if the weather is Go damp and cloudy, insects attack tho plants and sometimes do much damage. There are **msny** different kinas of rice, but the following rtre the six best grades, ranged in the o~der of merit : kzcmbhi, fciel, noining, gobi~adcc bhog, laikhuram . foi, and chahow. 

The only* variety of scgarcane raised in Manipur **sua.ro.ne.** 
has a hard red stem and is known as chu. A small patch of cane is often to be sew within the high mud walls that enclose the Manipuri homestead. but the total area under sugar is probably not large. The crop is propsgatod from the tops of the best canes which are cut off at, harvest time and kept in a shsdy place. One of these tops yields on the average about five canes, and as they contain but little juice, the cultivator does not sacrifice much of the gross product of llia fields in the cause of reproduction. The land is hood up till it is reduced to s fine tilth, and the tops planted in trenches between April and June. While the cmp is growing it is continuelly llocd and **wooded, and** about August the leaves should be tid up round **each clmtcr** of canes, though this troublusome precaution i~ occasionslly neglected. The e&h fiam the ridgee is heaped about tha mta to strengthen their hold upon the soil, and **this** process ie oontinued until the relative positions of ridge and trench are reversed, and the canes etand. upon the ridges with trenches in between. 

Peepsration ai **molurea.** The caue is pressed in the old-fashioned wooden mill. 

T~M consibts of two wooden rollers fixed side by side ib s trough hollowed out of a heavy block &' wood. The tops of the two rollers pass through a hollow beam 'supported by upright^ let through the lower Gock of dood bto the ground, and are cut into the foim of screws which fit into one another. To one of these rollers is 
&ed a pole which is driven round in a circlo, and thus causes the rollers to revolve. The motive power ie usually supplied by bullocks or bddoes, and opcasionally by tbd villagers themselvea The mill requires rather more kdowledge of carpentry for its produciiop thm the other implements of agriculture and can oay be made by the mom skilful of the **villagers.** we 'we is placed between the rollers and crushed RB it is slowly forcod through. Each handful ~IB pasae thhugh the mill three or four time8 **till** nothing bu 1 foam appears. 

Tho juice trickles fmm the trough **into** the earthen pot or korosineoil tin placed in a hole below it, **amd** hm thence is transferred to a large earthenware vessel. It is boiled over s furnace dug' in the ground, with **two** 
holes in the top for the reception of iron cauldrons. 

The Manipuris only boil the juice till it atteins the consistency of Lrelicle, **and** eat or sell it in this condition ; 
but the **Muealmens** continua the pmcosa till it **turns** 
into thiok **mobsem.** A few iron Bihie mills have been induced into the state, bu't **they** are rather hav to t-aport, and ea the area of any given of **oane** 
is smll, **this** ia a serioua draw back. 

verg little **jute is** raised in Mknipiir, and tho only **~ib~~** 
fibre of importance is cotton, which is extensively cdtivated by the hill tribes, and is sometimes grom on the low hills in the valley. It is generally sown in *jhum* from which a crop of **rice vrsa** taken in the previaus year. The ground is hoed up and the seed sown in Feb~ nary or **hh.** 'l'he fields are weeded in April **and** 
May, and the cotton plucked in September and October. 

There sre three flushes of which the second **It3** the best. 

Heavy rain injures the crop and a hailstorm sometime8 destroys it altogether. 

Tha other crop? grown in Mmipur are of little im- **other orom.** 
portance from a commercid point of view. Mustard is sown inside the house enclos-me or on the high land in the neighbourhood. A little **ti1** is dso **grown,** but the total quantity exported is quite insignificant. Matikalai, which furnishes the staple kind of *dal* used by the people, pew, chillies, cabbages, and other kinds of vegatables are groF on high land. The Monipur potsto is a **emell** red tuber, but the **Naini** Tal tlarieties wbich have recently been introduced at Kangjupkul are doing well. 

Oats and wheat have been tried and proved snocessful, When an atfa-eating regiment **waa** stationed in the valley, 
'he Manipuris grew a considerable quantity of wheat,, 
and foreigners set up water-mills to convert it **into** flour; but on it8 relief by a Gurkha regiment the people were loft without tb IIllWket for their grain, and the me8 under wheat **spin ~nk** to 8 very **smsu** figure. of pht.ins there **are sevon** or eight varietiee but none are of **good** quality. The trees die down in the winter **time, and in** 
Msrch are cut away, to allow s new ahoot to spring - up from the old stock. The area nut will not grow in tha 
. alley, amd the pan vine (piper betle) **has** unusually small leaves. A larger variety of pan is, however, grown in the valleys that intersect the hills. The plants are trained-up trees, 81s is the custom in the Assan valley, and are noi grown in enclosed gardells after the fashion followed by the Baruis of Bengal. When the soil **and** climate are favourable pan iu an ostraordinarily profitable crop, and some Naga villages in the valleys of the Barak and Irang are said to make as much as Be. **200** per hollse per ennum from pan alone. Oranges, pine-apples, and jack fruit thrive in the valley, but limes do not do well. Mangoes blossom and fruit luxuriantly, but the worm which ruins this fruit in Assam does not spare it in 
. Manipur. There nrs, however, a few late-bmring tree0 they yle!d excellellt fruit. Various kinds of Engliuh fruit trees have been tried but so far have not proved particularly successf ul. 

TO~~CO. Tobacco is cultivated as a garden crop. The seedlings are raised in carefully-manured beds in August and Seytemhr. At the beginning of November they are transplanted into ground which **hae** been reduced to a fine tdth, and protected from the suu by little eections of the phutain trunk. The bed is lightly hoed up two or three times, and not more than ten or twelve leaves ere **dowed** fo grow on each plent, the remainder bebg picked off ee **they appear. The** leaves ere gathered in February **and M,** and there ia a second but much inferior crop stout two month8 **labre If required** 
for chewing they are dried under a shed, or **else pressed** 
into a hollow bamboo and Jlowed. to ferment. When the tobacco is destined for the pipe, the leave8 are **pile3** 
up in heaps till they ferment, cut up and mixed with molanses, and are then reedy for the hookah. 

The ordinary methods of cultivat~on practised in the in **L.kltivetion** the hille. 

The jhum hills is the syste~ known *snjhm.* he jungle growing on the hili side is cut down and burned between January aad March. The seeds of hill rice, millet, and Job's tears are dibbled in amongst the ashos, and while the crop is growing it is weeded once or twice. The millet is hrtrvested in July, the rice in November, and theJob's tears in the following months. Chillies, pumpkins, **and** til are also grown in the *jliz(nts,* and cotton ia a, very important 'rop. 

The system of *jlu1.11t* cultivation has many drawbacks. 

The crop is entirely dependent on the rainfall for the moisture it requires to bring it to maturity, much time and troubla has to be expended in the clearing of the **J~LTLF~S,** 
arid the amount of land required is very large. *Ajh~n* is, RS (t rule, only cultivated for **twr,** seasons in succession, and then allowed to fsllow for seven or eight **years.** 
After **tllle** second year the yield fall3 off and the weeds spring up and choke tho crop. There is a risk too that the roots of the scrub jcngle may he killed, and tha lend depends to **some** extant for it8 fertility on the grolrth of this young jangle **and** its subeequent convereion iilto a bed of ash mannro. A vilhge thus **requiree of cdturable** 
land about five times the arta actually under crdtivation at **any** given time, and the outlying *jhtw* of communities **mcst of** necesvity be sometimes situated at a coneiderable distance **from** the village site. 

 he **krrr0.d** A jhum, with crops springiug up amongst the oultiratfon of **the** lo- **ashes** and tho charred stumps of the trees, is undoubtedly Marun **.nd** . 

-* **BW-.** a primitive **form** of cultivrction, which is only possible in a very spareely peopled country. The te~raced cultivetion of the Mao-Maram and Tanknl Nagas discloses a capaoity for continuoue and sustained hard work which is seldom found in a community of semi-savages. The slopes of the hih below their villages are cut out into a succesmo~ of **terraces,** which are irrigated from the hill streams, whose water is csrefully distributed through little channels over every step in the series. Where the dopa is fairly gentle, these terraces are sometimes nearly twenty yards in breadth and not more than two feet high, but fields as large as this are by no means common. The average terrace is more than three feet high and is not more than three or four yards wide, and ia often built up with stone retaining **w~,lls.** Tn places these stone malls are much as five feet high, in places the terraces are not more than two feet wide, and, as they have to follow the contour of the hill side, they are never of any conaiderable length. 

An ample supply of water ie an absolute necessity for tab cultivation, and, where this is to be had, fields are cut out on elope8 which are almost precipitoue in their stespnees. Sometimes the terraces are aimply cut out of the earth and are not faced with stone. The initial lmbour required to make these terraced fields ie vewy great, **but** once mde they give lese trouble than e jJHYIIC. **Tbey** are cloee to the vill~ge site, jungle clearing and weeding are not neaeawy, and where they are irrigated from perennid springs the omp is absolutely sure and is not **affected** by variations in the Rinfall. *Jhm* rice also does not do well at elevatiom of more than 4,000 feet above the sea, and, were it not for their terraces, many of the Mao-Maram Nagas would have to subsist on millet and Job's tears. This **irrigated** rice is rsised in the same way as the *aali-dhun* of Aseem. 

The soil is thoroughly ~aturated with moisture and then hoed up till it- is reduced to a rich puddle. The **rioe** has in the meanwhile been eown on the hill side, and, when the plants are from a month to six weeks' old, they are tranfiplanted into the fields. Harvesting goes on in December, and the ears are cut.off ehort by the head and threshed in **th;r** field before being carried. up to the The cattle are strong, hardy, little **mimala much ~ireatoo~.** 
superior to the cattle of the Surma Valley or **Asssm.** They are probably akin to the Burmese breed, as the best animals are said to come from Kakchingkunao at the southern end of the valley. A bull costs from Re. 16 to Rs. **80,** a. bullock from Rs. 26 to Rs. 86, md a cow from Rs. 16 to Rs. 26. Some of the best cows are said to yield as much as three or four seers of **milk. The** buflaloee are also very fine animals and are used to drag the plough aa well as for dairy purposes. Considerable he& of them are kept by Nepalese settlere at the northern end of the valley, and a special reserve hae recently boen set apart for thew herdsmen in the Khoga Valley south of Moirang, to avoid the endless disputes whi~h have been caused by the animals **daaeging** the **mops,** when 11 miem **allowed to** eettle in the **neighbourbood** of Plliagea **ffmming** fees are levied on foreign herdemem at the rate of annes 8 for each biiffalo and annas 4 for each eder **hed** of horned cattle. COW buffaloes can be puraheed near Kanglatombi for from **Rrr.** 86 to Rs. 60, **mhlle** 
a bull **ooete** rather less. In the centre of the valley the prices **are s** little higher. Both cattle and buffaloes find a dy **eele** in Cachar, when exported to that district, and the **sturdy** little breed of bullocks has done muoh to develop the export trade along the cart ratid to ~akm. 

The cattle **are** grazed in swamps and on the hills, and sometimes on **rice** atraw, and there ia not, as a rule, **any** dearth of mitable pasture. The Lamphel and Taiel bile nesr Tlbphal have been specidly reserved -a~ gm~- 
ing **pun&.** Goats are not numerous, and the only eheep in **Mqipur** are a few that are kept for the consumption of the European residents. Poultry, like moat other living things, do very well in Manipur. A really fimt-cl.es hipuri pony is a splendid little creature, but good **animals** are ~nfortunat~elg very rare. They **are** generdly below twelve hands in height, but they have remarkable weed, courage, and endllrance, and will oarry a heavy **man** for many miles over rough or hilly country. Under native rule no attempt was made to **rlr'-** 
gulafe **bhe** breeding of the poniea ; e, good animal ww genedy appropriated for the Raja's atable, and, even &r long *ago* as 1869, McCulloch wrote that the genuine Manipuri horn had nearly diaappoared. In 1889,. the Paje waa pmented with an Arab stallion and eight Illcrree, but Arab oennot thrive in the damp climate of hipur, **mud** the imported **afook** died out. At preeed there are two Mane kept by the State, one s Bumasd one a emd **Auetrdan.** 
The farm implements, as in the rest of the H~vince~ **E*pl+** 
are simple and inexpensive. The plough **cou~iste** of s curved piece of wood, the front of which is shod with iron, fittod with a pole when drawn by a pair of bullocks, or a pair of ohafts if intended for a buffdo. The harrow is a long-toothed rake drawn over the fields by a, bullock, though sometime8 ite place is taken by a heavy log, which presses down weeds and rice alike. **'Ibe rica** 
springs up age& on the following day, but the weeds droop and die. The hoe that is used to trim the nib in the paddy fields has a long but very narrow blad~. The chuauing or flail is llke a wooden fork, with the handle bent at an angle of about 120 degrees. The handle is about 27 inches long, the prongs of the fork about 26. 

When the *dlban* has been threshed it is throwa into the air from rt long-handled wooden shovel *(pho in cho)* and winnowed with a mat. It ie then placed in large baskets and dragged to the homestead on a wheel-less sledge. 

For husking grain the Manipuris follow the fashion prevalent in the hills, and use a pestle and mortar instead of the *tllbenki* of the Assrtrn Valley. 

The following account of tlie forests of Manipur is **roreltl.** 
reproduced from the Gazetteer of Captain **Dun** :-- 
" The **whole of the hill ranges lying between the valley8** 
of Cncher and Menipur, and far to the north and south, are densely clotl~od to their s~immits with tree-jungle. Almost the only exception to this has been elready stated in the deecription of the Manipur Valley, and refers to the hill slopee facing it. 'I'heee elopee have been steadily cleared of their timber, end present e denuded Rppoerence.

In the Yomedung range, lying g etween Burma and Manipar, the jungle ie much more open, very large treee are rarer than either towarde the west or north, and the bamboo ie oonfined to the low-lying ground and ravinee. Fir treee are. occaeionally seen, but are not plentiful. The tee-plant is found in this renge, and epperently epreede over a large area. Teak ie common bo the slope overlooking the Kubo Valley. The cinchone would most likely grow well on the slopes of the hills, espmielly thoee lying neareet to the Manipur velley and in the Hlrok nmge. The tea-plant is common in the hills to the north. 

The only part of the immense forest trects which are ntiliaed ere those of the Jiri forest and the hill elopes lying nearest to the velley. From the hills to the south of the valley, most of the wood used in buildiug is obtainod ; some of the varieties are eaid to be proof against the ravages of the white-ant. From e tree fonnd to the north-east in the hills in considerable numbere, a black resinouo fluid is obtained, which is used for japanning by the Manipuris. The fir tree is found to be highly resil~ous, and the trees are of large size. Near the salt wells to the northeast of the valley, on the first low range of hills rising from it are numerous clumps of firs. To the south, the fir ie plentiful. 

Palm trees are found in the eastern slope of the Yomadung ran e, near Tammu in Burma, where a few ~upaI1 tress grow ; 
on t 5 e Keopum peak and the Nunjaibong range, whero the fan palm ie plentiful; and all over the hills on the north and wt, where a kind of palmetto is common.

THE **Manipuria** are neat and clever work people, who supply most of their own **wants,** and much of the clothing used by the hillmen. Were it not for the isolation of the valley, whoh cuts ~te inhabitants off to a great extent from outside markets, they could largely add to their resource8 from their induatriee. . The following is an mxount of the mom important of them.

Those aurioue in the matter would do well to consult the monogmph to which reference has been already made, where the whole question is discuused in the minutest detail. The four-poeter loom and the whole process of weaving ia described on pages **8C-48,** and the smaller loom on pagee **7'1** and 78. 

00- The cloths produced are of excellent quality **olom** 
and are extraordinarily cheap. Cotton cloth can be bought in the Imphal hazar for less than a halfpenny a square foot.* The fabric is a little rough, as Lome-made fabrics usually are, but it is Btrong ad fitout, and **weighs** an ounce or a little more to **the** 
square foot. It is obvious that it would be impoesible to produce lisnd-woven cloths at a profit at such rates with hirrd labour, but the induetry ie carried on by the women i~ their leisure honm, and even tho urnall- 
(\st return ahovo tho **ECC~UFII** cost of the **materials** is regardod as ~o much gaiv-d. The raw cotton hau geneally to be purchased, but apart from tbi there is absolutely no cash expenditure. The loom and other implemente of the craft sl-ffer from wear and fear, but the greater part of the loon1 i~ usna!ly **made** at home.

Some of them are white, with red or blue and yellow stripee, some red and blue, and others checks and tarhe, On other stalls will be found mosquito curfains and delicate muslin wraps which the women wear over their shoulders when in evening dress. A full list of the cotton fabrics produced in Manipur +ill be found in the monograph to which reference has been alreadv made, (pages **161-168).** 
The hnipuri silk-worm@ are of two mrieties, hanjanbi and himerol, and differ both from the pat, mug&, and **eri** of Assam and the **ttcss~w** eilk of Ben@. Both **kinds** a; r6ared indoors and are fed on' the leaves of the **mulberry,** or, failing that, on the leaves of two trees oalled by the Manipuris wdnu and *lou.* The eggs of the hsnja?rbi take ten or twelve days to hatch, the caterpillar attains itis full development in three weeks, when it is above 2) inches long, and another three dayc are roquired for the eyinning of the cocoon. The moth btches out ah eight or nine daya, and dies shortly after it **baa** laid ite **egge.** The egge of tho laimerol, on the other hand, take nine or **ten** month to hatch, and the caterpillar two month8 more **tio** attain to **ita** full growth, when it is about thm inchee long. The letter variety can only yield one brood in **the** year, while the former gives mme eight or nine, as it does not breed **during** the three winter months. 

The **silk** of the lairnerol is, however, superior both in quantity and quality to that of the hajanbi. 

The cocoo~ls are boiled and the thread is then reeled off. Three qualities are. recognised. The first is called rnzcga re1 and fetches about Rs. 18 a seer ; .the seadnd, *lmtgiai,* sells for RB; 7-8 a seer; and the, third quality, pangang, is only Rs. 2 a seer. The worms are delicate and are liable to epidemic diseases which sometimes carry off the whole brood. The principal **centres** 
of the indlistry are Kameng, Khurkhul, Phoyeng, Limareng, Kattumngjan, and Sagalmong. The **total** annual output is roughly estimated at some sixteen maupds, practically all of which is disposed of locally. Proposals have recently been made by Messrs. Anderson Wright and Coy. of Calcutta for the establishment of the silk industry in Manipur on a commercial wale, but the question is still under the consideration of tile Government. The people are intelligent and induatrions, **and** extremely anxious to make money, **and** anything which would add to their supply of ready cash would add materially to their comfort and do much in facilitate the administration of tbe State. The silk cloths which were given by the Raja to those of liis officers who distinguished themselves in battle are well known. The body is generally green or red, and along each side r?msa narrow border of embroidery. At either end there is a deep and very handsome border of silk embroidery, md a friuge of uilk. These shawb when new cost Rs. 86, but the mlours are then a little crude,'and the cloths, like wine, improve with keeping.

' The ealt water here doee not seem to have the same petrifying power ma that of Ningel, and the same observation holds good with regard to the other welle. 

Other wells. The other wells present no peculiar featuree. Seekong has four wella, Waikhong five ; from this well a superior quality of salt is obtained, which is set aside for the Raja and his immediate retainers : it can, however, also be procured in the bazercl at a slight advance' on the price of the commoner eort : it only differs from it in being cleaner.

In the days of native rule, salt was an important source of revcnue. Foreign salt was ecarce and costly, and the Brahmans were encouraged to declare that it could not be taken by a Manipuri without loss of caete. 

The industry was carried on by ~laves, or by forced labour, but the work is hard and, when the **come4** or 1aI.1bp was abolished, di5culties were experienced in cbtaining labour. Tho opening of the cart-road ha cheapened foreign salt, which in January, 1906, **wae** selling in Imphal bazar for geven pice a seer, aa compared with the four mnas charged for Manipuri salt. The old market women sometimes consult the feeling of the nora conservative of their customera by mixing this foreign aalt with a little dirt, and selling it in cake similar in form-to the dakes of Manipnri salt. The lset few yeam have shewn e eerious decrease in the *aalt* revenue of the ,stdie. In 1892-98, Re. 13,800 were received under this heed; in **1908-01b** the receipt0 were only Rs. 5,800. The wolls in the valley are put up to public auction. In the hills, iron cauldrons are supplied by the State, for each of which rent is levied at the rate of Re. 1 per mensem. 

Iron is found in the shape of small pisolitic nodules **Iron.** 
of hydrated oxide of iron intermixed with clayey matter. 

The best deposits have been discovered at Kameng, Kakchingkulen, and Kakchingkunao, and are generally at a depth of four or five feet below the alluvium. The Manipuris used to'dig up these particles of ore, and after washing away the earthy matter, heated them in a fire of straw till they became red-hot. The ashes were winnowed off, the ore pounded till it was reduced to powder, and the powder smelted in a charcoal firo. It is said that tho industry is now practically extinct a.nc1 tl~at foreign ore is almost invariably ~lsecl bv the local blacksinit,l~s. 

There 'are small deposits of limestone near Sllagunu **Lime~tone.** 
and Bislienpur, but larger quantities are found about 85 miles north-east of Imphal on the road to Ukrul. 

Copper is found in the soutll-cast corner of Mani- aopper and oosl.

A boy will come for as little as one rupee a month, and a grown man dl be content with four or five rupees. Domestic slavery was in existence in the days of native.rule, but the slaves were generally treated with kindness and consideration, differing from servants only in that they received no wages. 

Slavery is no longer recognised, and, though the eervents whose work is set against the interest of an advance thzt they will never he able to rcpay are not unlike the old domestic slave^, there is thiu important difference that, if they choose to leave their mastem, they mnl~t be recovered.

Pulseanre not **wry** cheap, ss Meni1)vr is not **sgreat** pulaepmducing tract, **and** the market ia subject to mnaidmble 18 flu&- In February 1901, 17 seers of matikulei **were** to be had for a rupee, but in the same month, 4 three years **later,** tlie price had fallen to 9 seers. **The** 
nod price seems to be about 11 seers for n rupee. 

Furthr **details** with regard to prices will be found in Table V. Hand-made cotton cloth is also extraordinarily chap, and in the knipur bazar stout cotton cloth can be bought at a half-penny the square foot. The one article of **daily** use that is dear in 3Imipur is the areca-nut, as it has to pay a heavy charge for transport. The usual market **rate** is from three to four pice a dozen, and as 6 Manipuri mill often eat twenty in a day, it forms 8 serious item in the family budget. 

mdne. bipur has not actually suffered from famine mithin recent years, but no less than twice the condition of **affairs** mas grave enough to be the cause of some anxiety. Much of the grain that had .been reaped in the winter of 1890-91 **was** clestroyed in the disturbances that took place, and, between August and November 1891, mom than half thc population mere subsisting on a aingle meal a day, and -began in consequence to show 
-8 of emaciation. In 1896, there mas again n scarcity iue to **the** poor harvest reaped in 1894-95, and to the export of rice to Kohima along the cart road. In the middle of August, rice **wae** practically unobtainable, a~ld the price went up to Re. 10 per maund. Fortunately the harvwt was a good one, and, by the end of December, the price hsd **hUen** to Rs. **2-4,** though that was very high for **bipur.** It ia far from likely that actual famine ever mnld mur, and the high prices **asked** in 1896 pmbably meant that no one lud my aurylua grain fo sell. The difficultiee of supplying the **State** from outside would, however, be immense, as all the grain would have to be carried 184 miles from Dimapui., along a road which at present has to be closed to cart-traffic in the rains. 

The staple food of the Manipuris is rice, of which they **~ood.** 
consume unusually large quantities. With their rice they generally take a dish of curried chillies, and they are very partial to dried fish, the local supply of which is eupplcmented by imports from Cachnr. They also take milk, molasses, potatoes, and other vegetables, and are very fond of the areca-nut. The areca-palm unfortunately will not grow in Manipur, and many tons of these nuts are carried into the valley every year across the seven ranges of mountains that divide it from Cachar. 

Qhi they dislike, and flesh of every kind they eschew, denying thcmselvcs even the vcnison which is permitted to the Mahapurnsliiyas of Assam. They prefer their fruit as a rulo unripe, and are very partial to lemons. 

There are two articles of diet, thc *tlto~.tr and yungclml,* 
which are not usually seen outsidc Manipur. The *t110r1~* is an aquatic plant mliose roots are catcn raw, and are rather like cocoanut though with a much fainter flavour. The yi~ngchah, or monkoy rice, resembles a giagrsntic pea pod. It is generally about ono foot long but is very thin ia proportion to it. length. 

The ordinary Menipuri house is always built after **HOWL** 
the same pattern. It is raieed a foot or so above the ground on e neat mud plinth, end is very long in proportion to ite breadth ; a typical houee **being** 60 feet by 17. The hont pert of the dwelling wnsiets of a porch or deep verandah about 15 feet in depth, ~th ndls on either side. It is kept scrupulously clean, and .at0 as a sitting-room for the family; but, if a European M, much as puts his foot upon the plinth, tha whole of the house will forthwith be abandoned. The posts and beams in the better houses are made of wood, the roof of thatch, the walls of split bamboo plastered over with mud. But what strikes a visitor from the Asesm Valley is the extraordinary neatness of the whole building. There are no holes in the wslls where the mud plaster has fallen off, the floor and walls of the porch are scrupulously leeped, the door is made of timber and is set in a neat frame of wood, and the whole place looks like the home of a man who takes a pride in himself and bis surroundings. In front of the house is a piece of level ground which is carefully plastered with mud ancl cowdung, in the centre of which there is thc sacred *tulsi* plant. Here the Manipuri offers np prayer to Heaven, and paints his caste mark on his foruhead after taking food, and in the winter time hs generally protects the shrub from frost by erecting over it a light shed of bamboo and thatch. Oppositt: 
the house there is a cowshed, or, in wealthier houses, 8 weU-built barn with no wall on the side which faces towarde the house. This is used as a sitting-room when guests ere too nutnerous to be accomrnodatod in the **main** 
dwelling, **and** as a place in which looms and similar articles of furniture can conveniently be stored. The premises aro generally surrounded by a atout mud wall some foui feet high, from which tall **ikra** shoots **and** effectudly secure8 seclusion for the family. There is often too a hedge of **bcrmboo** round the garden, whizh is much more natly kept than the compounds of Assem. is very little jungle, a,nd the ground is covered with vegetables, tobacco, sugarcane, and even mustard and ~ulse. 

Such is the typical house in Imphal, and the houses of the villagers are built on the same plan, though they are emder and generally not so neat. 

But though the houses are well made, the furniture **Furaiture.** 
is, as a rule, extremely simple. Many people eat off plantain leaves, and in the house of the ordinary villager there are few brass or bell-metal utensils. 

This, perhaps, is due to the desire of being saved the rlabour of keeping the metal vessels clean, as the plantain leaf is simply thrown away after use, and the disagreeable process of washing up is thus avoided. The article of furniture in which the Manipuri takes most pride is his bed. The bedstead is made of wood, and in rich men's houses is very neatly carved. On this is placed a mattrese, and the thickness of this mattrees is a good c1ue.h the wealth and position of the owner. A rich mas's mattress ia sometimes fully two feet thick, and i covered with e piece of red woollen cloth and a longcloth eheet broad enough to rwh fo the ground on either side. For bed clothes they use blmkete and Msnipuri quilts, and the aize of the moequito curtains ie another index of the prosperity of the owner of the houee. At the mide of thin bed s met ia epread upn the **floor** Ion which either hueband or wife sleep when they are ill, as it i8 thought that 8 eick rmrn would be subject to attacks of **vertigo** if raieecl abovc the ground. Apart from this, there ie very **lit1 lc** in tho way of furniture. There are and baskute, and perhaps e **box** or two in the houses of the pooleat, and well-to-do people **will** have a few ohairs and tables, but chh do not, as s **mle, coma6** 
themeelves to the Bhipuri. 

Dnn. The Manipuris are a well-dressed people, and even when their wardrobe is not hrge they try to look aaclem and **smart** as possible. The ordinary dress of a villager is s dhoti and s sheet, but in Imphal town shirts and coata are coming into use. In the cold weather **moet** 
men use a padded cotton quilt as a wrap, and padded coata are &o sometimes worn. The ordinary dress of a woman is s cloth called **fanek** folded round the bust and reaching to the feet, while a cotton shawl is thrown over the head and shoulders. In addition they sometime8 wear a short jacket which is often' made of satin or velvet. TheJzneks are generally made of a striped material, and have a ueat border at the top and bottom of embroid&ed silk. They are, however, strained tightly across the bosom and thus completely apoil the shape of the bust. On **gtrln** days the **funels** of the well-to-do are of a bright and pretty pattern, and across the shodclcrs girls wear nothing but a gauzy wrap of delicate **and** 
transparent muelin; a costume which is not unlike a rather low-cut Empire gown. In the days of the late Rajas special merit **was** rewarded by the right to **wear** 8 particular kind of coat or cloth. The silk sh8wb bestowed on those who distinguiehed themselves in htde are extremely handsome. The body is red or peen, at either end there is a very deep border of embroided silk. Men generally we~r their hair short, with the exception of the little lock at the back of the **bep whioh** 
's prcmrved by dl devout Vaishnaviter. ~ndd girls wear their Lair long behind. In front it is phatered down over the forehead in a deep fringe **whioh** mmh& almost to the eyebrows; **and,** not content with this, they let it **hang** in rt sort of fringe at the side of the head over the cheeks and ears. The effect is thus exactly that of an Egyptian mummy. When a girl ie betrothed, **this** fringe cannot be cut without the consent of the **future** 
husband. Married women let their hair **grow,** and **turn** 
it back and knot it over the nape of the neck after the fashion that is usually in force in Eastern Bengal ; but here again the hueband's rights come in, and he must be tlie first persGn to turn back his wife's hair. 

Though to outward seeming unusually prosperous, *z;~ez,* 
thc Manipuris are not really very well-to-do. **They live peOple.** 
in good houses and are always clean and neatly dressed, but tlie peat majority of them have very little cnsli. 

In **fcw** placcs is nature morc bou~it~iful tha.n in Maniyur, but owing to its isolatioli **tlic** inhabitants are **unable** b find n market for their protiucc. The problem that presses most urgently for solutioll is tho introd:lction of capital into tho valley. While heavy csiwuditure **was** bcing incurrcd cin public works, tllc lwnplc **11nd litt,lc~** 
difficulty in oLt,ai~~ing cash to pay t,llcir land **rcvcnltrs,** 
but this sol~rce of tricomo has now **bc~111 c.onsitl~~~:~l)ly** curtailed. Givcn a, market,, tlle Maniput-is could easily **L~~OIV** 
rich ; but with **rice** sclling at 16 arlnau a maund, **mcl** 
stout home-made cotton cloth at id. per **quare** foot tllero must evidently only be a small margin of profit. 

At the same time there is not much indebtedness, **the** 
foreign traders being far from certain whether they would recover any **ndvancoe** they might make. 

c~unl0.- 
tlonr. There ere three roads mhicll connect the town of Imphal with the outside world; the cart road over the Naga Hilb to the Amam-Beagal Railway at Dimapur which has a total length of 134 miles ; the bridle path to Cschar **vici** Bishenpur and Jirighat ; and the bridle path via Thobal to Tammu, and thence across the Kubo valley **into** the valley of the Chindwin. 

The cart road enters the Manipur State at Mao thana, which is 67 miles from Dimapur **and** nearly 6,600 feet above the level of tho sea. From there it descends steadily along the contours of the hills, and the next bungalow at Maram, 18 miles from Mao, is only 4,596 feet above sea level. From Maram to Kairong bungalow tllmc ia a drop of 1,200 feet in a distance of 18 miles. Tlio road at this point crosses the upper waters of the Barak, which, though but a shallow stroam in the cold weather, comes down in heavy spate during the rains. Even when in flood the river is hardly more than four feet deep, but the current is so swift that it is impossible for a ferry to be worked, and carts are sometimee detained for foar or five days till the violence of the stream abates. Foot peeeengere can cross by a light suspension bridge, and a fine bridge capable of carrying heavy traffic is now 
(1906) in come of construction. From Kairong **tltc** road gradually rises to the Maiangkang watersl~cd eome 600 feat above the valley, and then drops again to Kangpokpi, 18 milee from Kairong. The next stage is to Kanglatombi 18 miles, and from there it is 15 milee into the town of Imphal. All of the staging bungelowe ere bdt of atone, contain three roome, and are not only f&hd with **beds,** tables, snd **chire,** but **are** supplied with glass and crockery. Only about 85 milea of the road between Imphal and Mao thana are metalled. 

The hills through which the road has been carried are largely composed of soft grey shale, and the uzzmetalled portions become so bad after wet weather, that during the rains the road is sometimes closod to cart traffic. 

The whole of thiv road is still under the charge of the Assam Administration, but the State makes an annual contribution of Rs. 30,000 towards its maintenance. 

The first 17 miles of the Cachar 'road from Imphd ~h bridle e Cwhu **path.** 
past the Foiching rest-house (9 miles) to the Bishenpur bungalow, lie along tlie valley and are drivable, but at 13isllenpur the roa,d turns sharply to the east and sicks to the status of a bridle path. The stage from Bishenpur to the next bungalow at Laimatak is only 18 miles in length ; but the traveller has to ascend nearly **2,000** 
feet to the summit of the Laimatol range and then **drops** nearly **8,600** feet to the Laimatak river. The next halb ing place is at the Kaopum, 12 miles further on over the Loangba, range, which entails a climb of **2,700** feet and a descent of **2,000** feet the other side. Then comes a comparatively easy march of nine milee to Irang. To the summit of the Kaopum range it is only s climb of **600** feet, but on the other side there is a drop of 2,800 **feet in less** 
thtul four **milee. After** leaving the **Irmg** bungalow, the path cmsaes the Irang range (1,980 feet above the level of the sea), drops to the Lengba stream, and then climbs once more to the Nongba rat-house which is 2,710 feet above mean lea level and 12 miles from Irang. From Nongba there is a mamh **of 18** miles, the greater part of whioh i on m es0y downward slope to the bungalow in 14 the valley of the Bank. Tho **next** stage is only 11 miles in length, bnt the path mounts 2,600 feet to cross the Kab Nags range, and descends nearly 3,000 feet to the **Makru** bungalow on the other side. From Makru it ie a march of 15 miles with 8 climb up and down of 1,600 feet to Jirighat, the frontier of Manipur, whence it is another 24 miles to Silchar **town.** The path thus cmseee soven ranges of hills and five main rivers, and in the course of 86 milee the traveller from Manipur has to ascend altogether over 19,000 feet and descend rather more than 14,006 feet. Nearly all the rivers along this road are crosaed by &re suspension bridges, with the exception of the Jiri, over which a ferry is maintained. 

The Tammu bridle path. South south-west of Imphrtl runs the road to Tammu on the Burmese frontier. There are staging biingalows at Thobal on the 14th, and Yale1 on the l!)tl~ mile, and br the first 81 miles the road is drivable. From there to the Burmeee frontier there is nothing but a bridle path, and beyond Aim01 on the 85th mile there are no rest-houses. From Tammil it is only 24 mile^ across tho **Kubo VaUey** and a range of hills to Sittang on the Chinilwin river. 

The only other driving roads in tbe Manipur valle J 
outside Imphal arc: the continuation of tl~e Bishenpur rod to Moirang, and **tho** rond to tho foot of the bills below Knngjupkul. None of these roads are metalled, with the exception of the road to Dimapnr, **and** are thusliable b be mudl cut up if required to carry **heavy** traHic in the rai-nn. The rivera **are** generally crossed by **wooden** 
bridges, and ae the timber is of poor quality and soon rot. if **cxpnnnl** tn the action of the westher, it is found ohesper to **cover** them with a **root** of thatch, aoustom whioh gives them a somewhet singular eppearmce. 

There **are** only **thv** post officee in Manipur which are Telepraph. p 00t **and** 
situated st ImpM.and **Mao** thana. Twu lines of post are maintained by the **State,** to Kohima which is reached in about bO horn, and to Tammu which is reached in about two days. Government also keeps up a line to Silchar which is reached in 60 hours. The mail is carried in each case by runners. Between Kohima and Imphd the runner carries what is known as an "open bag," so that let- **can** be received and posted by any person travelling along the riad. A telegraph line crossea the Nega Hills, passes;\through Imphal, where there is an office, and enters Burma *vili* Tammu. 

The internal **tde** of the State is carried on at Cornmeme and trade. 

markets held in the open air, and outside Imphal such **trade. Internal** a thing as a permanent shop iu practically unknown. 

Even in the **town** iteelf there are only 36 shops, 29 of rvll~ch are krpt by the shrewd 18erchants of Marwar. The principal articles offered for sale at these shope are cotton goods and thread, umbrellas, braas and bell-metal utensils, oil anrl fancy goods, with flour and other kinds of grain. 

Foreigners are not allowed to open shops in the interior, and thb Manipuri, though he is fond enough of trade, is not a shopkeeper. Markets are, however, held all over the valley whioh are largely attended by the villagere. 

In Imphal itself there are no les~ than 18, but all are completely everehadowed by the great afternoon **bezar.** 
The day **berar** in aituted **neer** the briok bridge over the Nmbol, and is a vey reapmtable market aa markets go. 

Theafternoon bar ie only a **few hundred v&** weet ot' the morning bazar, and is held on a fine level piece of ground in which there is ample elbow room. **This** is, no doubt, the reason for the change of site, for to the casual visitor it at first seems strange that the business centre of the **t8awn** should be shifted a few hundred yards just at the close of day. At 8-30 P.M. the place is absolutoly deserted. There are the Hty-five low plinths on which the women sit, but there is nothing to suggest thadthis is a place of business, and the caeual visitor could easily imagine that he was looking at the eite of rows of unfinished cooly lines. An hour-and-a-half later the place is white with people. There are from 2,000 to 8,000 women sitting behind their wares, and the throng of purchasers is even larger. The prices are extraordinarily cheap aud the articles cffered for eel0 moet miecellaneous in their character. There is **ptton** in the raw, cotton thread, c&epers that are used as dyes, and enormous quantities of cotfon cloths of dsemnt colours and pab terns. There are cotton-padded **quilta** end **ooata,** hats, and shoes, and various other articlee of dmes. Excellent epecimens of **breee** work are on **aale,** in addition to the eicklee, doos, and hoea that the cultivator needs. llattreesee are there, bamboo **m~ts** and basketa, jewellery, and pottery.. In addition to dl these mieoellaneoue articles, there is s **large** store of **grain** of various **kinds.**

Tea **aeed** and buffaloes **are** imported from Burma, but r-m 
'l'rd*. 

moet of the trade of the **State** is with Cachar and the Assam Valley. The principal exports to Cwhar are cattle, and timber and other forest produce from tlr State foreete on the **western** frontier. **Tee. seed wse** at one time an **importent** article of export, and in 1896-97 wes valued at about Re. **1,75,000.** Almost the whole of thie eeed ame originally from Burma, so that the **State** sufm fered comparetively little loss when the deprem~d state of the tea industry put an end to the bade. Tea seed was, however, a eource of oonsidembie revenue to the Raja in the days of native rule, as he kept the monopoly of it in hi8 hands. 

The principal **importe** are **cotton** pieae-goods snd yam, dried fish, and betelnuts. Rice is exported in considerable quantities along the oart **mad to Dimapur,** and, were it not for the fact that all tdo ie at present eue pended in the rains, the trade would probably be considerably larger. At the same the it muet be borne ixi mind that, cheap though rice is in Manipur, it **has to** bear a heavy charge on account of freight; and when prices are aa cheap in Assam ae they were st the beginning of 1905, there is very little profit in the business. The principal imports by this route are cotton yam and piece-goods, kerosine oil, *glb4* ,it, end sugm.

Sylhet has had excellent cart roads for many yeare, yet there is hardly a cart to be hired in the district; and it is difficult to recall a single industry in Assam which has been developed by the natives of the Province with such remarkable rapidity. The Manipurie are, however, a very imitative people, and, like the Khasis, are willing to give any novelty a trial. The art of making carts and cart wheels was speedily acquired, cattle in Manipur are cheap and good, and in a surprisingly short space of time a flourishing transport business was established. Freights are in consequence unusually low, and the charge for sending a maund of goods the 184 miles from Dimapur to Imphal is only eight or ten annas in the dry weather. From Imphel to Dimapur the rates are generally higher and are seldom less than Re. 1-8 per maund.

 and **Re- THE** following description of the way in which land venue. revenue **waa** realized in the days of native rule ia taken from the work by Dr. Brown :- 
" The whole land system of the valley etarta with the aesumption that all the land belongs to the Raja, and ,is hie to give ewey or retain, as he pleases. Under the **Rdje is 8n** official, named the Phoonan Saloornba, whose duty it is to superintend all matters connected with land cultivation. He look0 after the rneasuremerrt, receives the rent in kind, nnd tranetrcta ell bueiness matters connected with land on behalf of the Raja. 

The lend is subdivided into villagee and their eurroundina~ : the headman of each division or village looks after the cultiv~~tion, and is responsible for the realisation of the tax payable in kind by each cultivator; he holde no interest in the Imd, **and** is merely an agent of the Raja. 

Besidea the land tbns direct,ly, it were, cnltivetecl for tile Raja, grant8 of lend lire given to officials and favoiirites, Bornetime8 for their own lives only, or fol- a specified time, ~ometimea for themselves and descend* t~. 'rllese hold their lende on payment of the usual **tex** in ki d . connection^ of the Raja, Bn~llmans, and sepoye, pay no rent or **tax** on n fixed proportion of land regulated in ench case, but on any incre~~e on the land cultivated ebove that proportion rent ie paid, The proportion of land cultivated under whet may be celled the direct eynteln on account of tho Raja ie about fi third of the whole, .acher more than a third is in the poabeeion of members of the ruling family, Brebmans and sepoye;' tho renainder is in the hands of the headmen, officiale, etc., who hold it by favour from the Raja. Each individual liable for *lahp* or forced labour for the State, is entitled to cultivate for his support one pari of land, subject to the payment of the regular tax in kind. 

The tax in kind realised from eech cultivator, and which goes to the Raja, is lieble to many modificatione, although in theory the tax is a fixed one. The tax as given by MoCdloch varies from two basket8 to thirteen from eech *pa&.** I am informed that the two baskets, which nominally should only be taken from everyone alike, is realised from favouriteq and that the average from others may be tlet down at 12 baskets yearly : 
this is seldom exceeded, except in rare emergenciee, as war, kc. This, again, will only apply to land cultivated for the Raja or held by those subject to *lalup.* In cases where lands are held by officials, etc., as middlemen, the burdens are more severe, running as high as twenty-four baskets per pa^, which I am informed is the outside limit. The average yield per **pari** is about 150 baskets annually ; each basket contains about 60 pounds." 
In addition to this tax in kind each male between T~O **1.1~~** or JOrVBO. 

17 and 60 was supposed to render to the State **ten** days' labour out of every forty. The people seem to have been divided into different guilds, to each of which was allotted the duty of providing some particular article of use or luxury required by the Raja and hie numerous retinue. Some, for instance, would build the roads and bridges; to others would be assigned the various crafta, the manufacture of brass or bell-metal utensils, of jewellery, or of leather work. Others again would be deputed. to the personal service of the Raja and his followers. A 
list of the different guilds, as recorded by Dr. **Brown,** has already been printed on page 65. A similar system was in force amongst the Ahome, and, were it not for the difficulty of checking abuses'in the working, it is a system whioh i not entirely umuited to the con&ion~ of **life** 
upon the North-Eest Frontier. Labour is the one thing in **which** the inhabitants are really rich ; it ia the one thing that can be taken from them and them no / **.--4** 
poorer than before. Nearly every m n uite idle for a considerable portiok of the year, and the native rulers did not heeitate to avail themselves of this great store of potential **labour** which now uqfortunately goes to naste. 

It doee not eppesr from the reports of either Br~m or McCdoch that the people found the system of *hlup* particularly irksome or oppressive, though in the cast of the Manipuri~ it waa combined with a much heavier fax in kind thmn was levied from -the subjects of the Ahom **kinge.** Major-General Sir James Johnstone, 8 former Politid Agent of Manipur and an officer who wae full of sympathy with the natives of thie country, described the *hlup* system in the following terms **and** 
muah regretted that it wae.entirely abolished not only in Manipur **but** in Aeeam :- 
"The eyetem wee e good one, end when not carried to exceee, pmesed heevily on nobody. It **wee** especielly edepted to e poor state apareely populated. In such e stete, under ordinary circumetenoea, where the amount of revenue is smell, and the **rete** of wagee often comparatively high, it is next door to impoeeible to carry out many mnch-needed public worke by payment. On the other hand, every man in Indie who lives by cultivntion, he much spare time on hia hands, end the ' *hkup* ' 
profitably utilieee this, end for the benefit of the communlty et er~. Inever heard of it being complained of as 8 herdehip. The eyetam in heem led to the completion of many wefd **and** widcent public worke. High embanked medo were **made,** throughout the codntry, and lerge tenks, lekes, approprirhely termed 'se~? were exceveted under this ent. Many of th9:greet work8 of former **egee** in @her 
=ndb are due @hmething of the urns kind. 

It wee e ed mietake giving up the eyetern in Amsm without retaining the right of the state to e certain number of daye' labour on the roads every year, as is the custom to thie day, I 
believe, in Canada, Ceylon, and other countries."* 
When the State came under British adminietration **gz;~~,** 
the system of *lal?tp* was abolished. Under the Raja **?;:fal.** 
the people were compelled to attend at Imphal, but very little super-rision was exercised over the tale of work, and half of them, perhaps, sat idle. The more businesslike arrangements of the British put a stop to all this loafing, and thus produced considerable discontent. This discontent took a practical and very objectionable form, and the people began to emigrate to Cachar, s thing which had not been allowed in the days of native rule. 

Lulup was accordingly abolished, and in lieu of it, a tax of Rs. 4 per **yuri** was assessed on all settled land in the valley. In **1898-94,** this rate was raised to **Rs;** 6 per pari or Bs. 2 per acre. Though low enough in itself, the assessment is probably quite as high as the peculiar economic conditions of the State permit. In 1904, Lieutenant-Colonel Maxwell, who had been Superintendent of the State since 1801, reported that rice **was** so cheap that it hardly repaid the cost of cultivation, with the result that some difficulty was occasionally experienced in obtaining the money required to yay the revenue. M7hen the State first came under British administration, the land was managed directly from the Superintendent's office. This was, however, but a **tempormy** expedient, and in 1894, tho valley was divided **info** four .- 
& 
or f8hsi18, each of which had a revenue demand of about half a lakh of rupees. The tahsildars, or hkpa8, received a commission of 10 per cent. on their collections, but were required to defray the charges of their eetablishmenta, which amounted to between Rs. 1,800 and Re. 1,700 per annum. A tax of Rs. 2 was levied on each homestead, the garden ground was not assessed to revenue, and a staff of eight amins, under an official known as an **Amin** Lakpa was engaged in measuring up the land. 

The mes- 
.-merit Experience showed that the Eakpas required much the valley. closer supervision than so smd a staff could give them. At the end of three yeare, the arrears, good and bad, amounted to no less a, figure than Re. 86,000, or about onethird of the total land revenue demand, and it was obvious that some reform was necessary. The size of the panw was accordingly reduced by the erection of Imphml into a separate panna, the lakpas were relieved of all work connected with the settlement of new la~d and the registration of titles, and a Sub-Deputy Collector was appointed with a staff of four kanungos and forty amips to measure up the valley. The meaeurement **was** 
made on the non-cadastral system with a, rod, and **was** completed by March Blst, 1899. After deducting the homestead land which was still aasessed to house-toax, it wee found that the assessed area had risen from 266,000 bighcre to 820,000 *bighae,* sn increase by re-meeeuremeot of no less than 66,000 *bighas.* The survey staff waa then reduced to twenty amins under two kanungoes working under the general direotion of the flub-Deputy hlb~tor. In tho following **year** the house-tax wae abolished, and the homeetead land was measured up and agseesed to revenue at the ordinary rate; a measure whioh produced a small increase of 4.per cent. on the previous revenue demand. 

The principal registers on which the land revenue aeeeesment is baaed are the *dicg-chittas* which record the name of the oocup- of oach field, and the *jamahandhis* which ehow the number of fields included in each patta. 

The patta or lease confers no title to the holding, but in practice, when land-is.taken np for purposes of State, it 
\ 
- 
is customary to give the owner compensation. Land is crlso bought and sold and mortgaged as though the occupant had ; valid legal title. For estates which pay more than Rs. 10 in reyenue, the revenue is due in two inetalments, one-half on January 11 6th, one-half on March 16th. The revenue on smaller estatee is paid in one ineta,lment on Janucv 16th. Revenue ie collected by Lakpaa, who move about throllgh the areas committed to their charge. It wae at one time thought that these toure were the cause of some inconvenience to the people, aa they were compolled to support the Lnkpa9s large and sometimes needy retinue ; and in 1002-08, they were ordered to remain at their headquart-srs. Experience ehowed that the Mhniyuri would-not come in to pmy his revenue unsolicited, and the system of touring had to be revived, The Manipuris are allowed to reeign their land, provided that they give notice to the land revenue authoritiee on or before December 81st. 

During the laet three yearre, the average area of land resigned and of new land taken up wtu 2,049 and 8,9418 **wrea** respectively. Further details with regard to land revenue will be found in Table VII. Them ie still a considerable area of uncultivated land in the valley. In **many** cases, however, some capital expenditure wonld be required either to drain it, or to bring more water on to it, before it would be fit for cultivation. 

The principal obetaclee to the exteneion of cultivation are scarcity of labour and the low price of rice, which does not offer eufFicient profit to stimulate the villagers to further exertiona. 

Houre Tax. Amongst the hill tribes a tax of Rs. 8 is levied on each house, and no attempt ie made to measure up the aree under cultivation. The hills are dividod into five lams, each of which ie in charge of a Manipuri offioiel called a *Lam* eubadar, aesisted by some eight Manipuri 7tzrnh~ or peons. In the north, there is the Mao **Lam,** and the Tukul Lam includee the hills along the northeast of the valley. South of the Tankul country is the Tammu **Tif7,m** ; the Moirang *Lam* is in the mnth-west corner of the **State,** and the Kapui *I;a?~l~* to the north of it. The hill **man,** like other savages, ie not as simple ae he looks, and cloes not pay a tax if he can help it. In 1999, a M~nipuri enumerator who was checking the housee in a Tankul village, found that no loss **than 30** 
belonged to **midowe,** who, according to the rulee in force, are exempted from aeaessment. This number eeemed BO 
tlisproportionately large that he determined to pursue his **inveatigations** farther. At the dead of night he retuned with the village eldera and found seventeen of these eo-called widowe quietly eleeying with their huehande, who were forthwith seeeeeed to revenue.

Fish is an important article of diet in Manipur, and il.aerim. 

there are no less than 87 fisheries which are regduly put up to auction, ih addition to minor streams, *bils,* and the Loktak lake in which anyone is allowed to fish free of charge. The fo'lowing are the most valuable fisherie~ : The Waithou Shorien and tho Waithou Yhoomow are two *bils* about eleven miles from Imphal, on the road to Thobal, which in 1903-041 fetched Rs. 6,460 and Rs. **1,476** respBdively. The E kope *bil,* south of ' 
Thobal sold, in that year, for Rs. 8,170; the Kajipat bil, a little to the eouth of the town, for Rs. 1,410; and the Poomlen *bil,* near the **Loktak,** for Re. 1,000. The only bther fishery which in that year fekhed more than Rs. 1,000 was the Yangoi river, near the Loktak, which was knocked down for Rs. 1,860. The auction purchasers genernlly admit all the persons likely to frequent the fishery into partnership, and share with them the profit or the lorn, if by any chanco losb accrues ; but in the case of riven a **cees** is ~~~a~i~nally levied on **each** 
net employed. The *biLP* are filled wit11 water in the reins when the rivere aie in flood, and gonerally dry up in the cold eeaeon. Most of the fish are caught by the simple expedient of **eetting** wicker-work tmpe at the 18 places where the water draine **back** into the rivers. All the water that enters the exteneive Waithou *bit?* **drains** 
back through a narrow gorge between two hills not more thsn ten or fifteen yards in width. During the fishing maeon ae many as two hundred women will be seen sitting here every morning, waifing to buy the catch of the previous night. A succession of high floods followed by a rapid fall of the water is the condition of affairs most favonrable to the fishing industry. The net that is most generally in use is a square-shaped piece of netting **with** s pocket in the centre ; the opposite corners of which are fixed to the four ends of two flexible bamboos crossed above it in the shape of an X. A stout bamboo is attached to it as.a handle, and the net, in fact, differs in no way from the **parangi** of Assam. The ordinary cast net of Assam or **kewali** is also used by the men. Strange to my, the Manipuris in spite of their religious bigotry have not the smallest scruple with regard to the sale of fish. 

Even Brahman women will act aa fishwives, though amonget most Hindus the sale of fieh is reetricted to the very lowest castes. Anything that cannot be eold or eaten fresh ie dried in the sun, or, in the caae of lsrge fish taken in the hill streama, over a big fire. The bat eating fish are **surely, ngaru, kharoubi,** pemha, nga *khra,* 
and *ngatel;* but none of them spped strongly to the European palate.

The poppy used formerly to be cultivated by the Muhammadans. It was found that opium was being smuggled into British territory, and orders have recently (1905) been issued to prohibit poppy cultivation. Rice beer is brewed by mixing a yeast made of powdered rice and the roots of a creeper with boiled rice, and leaving it to ferment. Spirit is also dietilled from this liquor by primitive native methods. 

During the minority of the Raja, the administration **Govarnmant** 
of Manipur has been vested in the Superintendt:nt of the State. Separate offices are maintained in separate buildings for the Superintendent of the State and Political Agent, though the two functions are unlted in the single individual. This is necessary, ae when the Raja is entrusted with the administration of thcl country, the State office will be made over to him; The Political Agent is assisted by a member of the Assam Commission. The land revenue administrat ion is supervised by a Sub-Deputy Collector lent by the Assam Government, and public works are in charge of ti State enpneer. 

For the purposes of the administration of justice wmzt the valley is divided into eleven ciroles, in **eech** of which there is a pailchayrtt court. These **courts** have power to try civil u~lits in which the eubject-matter in dispute does not exceed Re. 60 ; and crimind offenoes of a minor degree, *i.e.,* tlilnple hurt, aasault, trespase, adultery, which, as has **elready bccri** uxplained, is not considered (I 
how offence by **the** Manipuris ; and theft and mischief where the prop,erty stolen or injured is not valued at mow than Ra 60. The only penalty which the panohyat **courte** can inflict is fine, and that must not exceed Re. 60 in **rural** areas. The town panchayat at Imphal can **impow fines** up to Rs. 100 and can decide civil and criminal cases of an equal value. Rural panchayats have been opened at Sengmai, Maklong, Foiching, Kameng, Moimng, Wangoi, Kokching, Chairel, Ningel, and Bemonkombu ; but they are said to be of little use, and they only decide a few disputes of a petty character. A 
specla1 panchayat court also sits at Lilang for the trial of **casss** between ~uhammadan Manipuris. Members of **the** rural panchayats are remunerated by the allowance of one @* of rice land free of revenue while in office, but members of the town panchayat receivo no leee tban twenty-five *paris.* Above the panohayate comes the Chimp, a court composed of five magi~trates which sita in Imphal. They can try civil suits up to any value, and all criminal cams except murder and offen= @net the State, but they cannot award rnm: 
than two yeare' rigorous imprisonment, a fino of Rs. **600.** 
or a flogging. Appeals from the town panchnyat lie the Chirap, **each** member of which is remulerated while in **office** by the grant of fifty *park* of land frce of rcvenue.

for life ; but the confirmation of the Chief Commiesioner is required whenever the 'death penalty is imposed or

imprisonment for more than seven years. Manipuri cuetom is to a great extent ' followed in the courts, and the penalties prescribed differ to some extent from those laid down in the Penal Code. Adultery, for instance, is only punishable Gith fine, md pettv theft with fine or flogging.' 
The prdent cohrts are said to be too cumbersome for the prompt der~patch of businees, and the question of replacing them by Manipuri magistrates and munsifs hae been ahead mooted. Most of the criminal cases copsist of petty t E efts of property and cattle, and hoysabreaking. Table VI shows the e quantity of criminal and civil work di~posed of. 

Under native rule thc punishments inflicted were Punimhmento. 

not unf requently excessively severe. The murderer used originally to be executed in the way in which he killed his victim ; I~ut Colonel Johnstone, when he wss Political Agent, succeeded in inducing the Raja to order all persone sentenced to death to be beheaded. The victim was thrown on his back upon the **ground,** the **back** 
of hie neck was placed on the trunk of a plan'fain tree,

and the **hesd** hacked off. Flogging took pfaae in the afternoon bazar, and sometimes se many as 600 laehes were administered ; a whi y ping which occasionslly proved fatal to the unfortunate recipient: Women were never imprisoned, and, at the present day, sentences of imprisonment are very seldom passed on women, so strong is the prejudice of the Manipuris on the subject. The form of punishment inflicted was, however, much more opposed to the ideas of decency prevailing in the West. The guilty woman was stripped naked save for a tiny apron of cloth. Her breasts were painted red, and a sweeper's brush fastened between her thighs. A 
rope **was** then put round her waist, and she was led in this disgraceful plight through the crowded afternoon bazar. Over her naked buttocks was suspended a small drum, and a second man followed behind beating the drum' and proclaiming her ofl'ence. Women who had passed through this ordeal generally allowed an interval of several months to elapse before they again appeared in the bazar, and it thus had the affect of confining them for a time to their own houses. 

Polioe and Jam. There is a regular system of rural police in the valley; a chdkidar, who is elected by the people subject to the approval of the. Political Agent, being appointed tn every hundred houses. There is, however, only one civil police' station in the State, which is situated at Imphal, and the whole civil police force consists of 19 men under a Sub-Inspector. A battalion of military police is -kept up by the State, which has a sanctioned etrength of 18 commiesioned officers and 864 non-commimioned **officers and** men. The men wear a neat uniform of dark green cloth, and are armed with mwcle-.

The chaukidare are useful as a reporting agency, and sometimes bring to light ingenioue frauds which have been perpetrated by Manipuri swindlers. On one occasion, an escaped convict collected Rs. 600 amongst the Nagas'to pay for the Political Agent's passage home. 

The trick was exposed by a Naga, who met the Political Agent and expressed some surprise that he should still be there, ae several months before he had paid Rs. 6 towards the cost of his steamer ticket. On another occasion, a bill from a Calcutta tradesman, headed with the various mate of arms that sometimes adorn these documents, waa wed as a Government parwaxta, authorising the levy of a cess of Re. 2 per house to be paid to the bearer of this imposing piece of paper. Another case occurred in 1904, when some convicts, marching with a warder through the valley, collected Rs. 400, on the pretence that it was to be used for the reconstruction of the house of the ~ssistaslt Political Officer, which had been burned to the ground 8 short time before. 

The Jail is au~ounded by e fine brick wall and **h$e** 
wmmodation for 100 prieoners. The walls of the wsrds are made of whole **bamboos.** The prisoners **.re** 
usually employed on extramural labour. 

muoation. m ducat ion, it need hardly be said, received littlc encouragement in the days of native rule. In 1869 Brown reported that there were no schools or any wish for them on the part of the authorities. Offers of assiatmce in the formation of a school were declined by the Maoipuris, who stated that they preferred to remain ignorant. Some of the highest oflicialo did not **how** 
how to read or write, and, like the knignts of the middle ages, despised such arts as beneath their serious conbideration. In 1872, a vernacular echo01 wae opened at Imphal, but the attendance wm extremely small, and very little was done by the Raja 01- his officere to stirnulate the cause of education. The Johnstone Middle English School **was,** however, opened in 1886, and, though it was closed for a time during the disfurbencee of 1891, it was reopened on June lst, 1892. In the following year two pathsalas were opened; and in **1908-** 
1904, there were in the State one Middie English, and one Upper Primary school and 28 pathsalae. Textbooks have been prepared in Mmipuri, and instruction is now given in that language. The year marked n great advance in the spread of education, and the Manipuria are evidently becoming sensible of ite advantqes. 

The number of pathaalas **waa** incregeed **from** eixteen to twenty-eight, and the daily average uttendanoe **rose** 
from 897 to 1,267. Female education haa as yet made little progress. A girla' school ws opened, but closed **again** in 1902 from motivee of economy. Thore am no difEcoltiem in the shape of wta **amupla** or the restrictions of the purdah to be overcome, but the 
+rewd Manipuri woman would have to be convmced of the practical value of education before she would send her child to school. In 1901, only 9 per mille of the population knew how to read and write, and the number of literate women 'was less than me per mills. It must not be supposed from this that the Manipuris are rude uncultured boors. Cut ,off as they are by their mountain walls from their fellow-men, it is not to be expected that they mould take much interest in the affairs of the outer world, and a literary education has few charms for them. But they arc well dressed, well housed, and clever craftsmen. Mea and women alike are full of enterprise and intelligence, and few people 
' 1 manage better without schooling than the Manipuri. 

Manipur is by -no means an unhealthy place. In 2;:;:;:. 

spite of the presence of myriads of moqquitoes, malarial **ft:/aur** 
but\li.Zie fO 
fever is not so prevalent as it is in the neighbouring e 1 **idernlor of** 
o olers. 

Province of Assam. The Manipuri is a larger and stronger **man** than the Assamese ; he is generally well developed, and without being lean he seldom rdns to fat. 

He does not **age** so rapidly as the plainsman of Assam, and once that the perils of infancy have been passed, the - 
mean duration of life is probably coneiderable. But, if he is fairly freo from fever and the general debility with which it is so frequently accompanied, he often paye a heavy toll to cholera. Drinking-water is ueually **taken** from the em~ll pond in the cottage garden into khich **all** 
the drainage of the compound ia delibrately carried. 

As though thie were not enough, the **pegph** weeh their olotbea, their cooking uteneila, and their pmns in thew 17 Mthy pooh, **and** then draw their drinking-mter from them* If the rain holds off too long in the spring, thre pond0 dry up, snd the people have recourse to the rivere, whioh heve by thie time Bunk to little more than ditchea creeping between high banks covered with etery kind of flth. The fimt flood brings doh this accumula€ion of impurities, **and** if they contain the germs of cholera, they are dimemihated with surprising rapidity throughout the valleq,. .The infectioq. is still further spread by the cuetom which dictates that the deqd should be burned on the river's **bank,** and that the corpse of a Bmhman, even if he has died of cholera, should be bathed in the river itself. Chdera is first mentioned in the Manipur State chroniclee in 1880, when it is said to have been the cauee of **heavy** mortality. In 1850, there was another serioua epidemic, and the Maharaja, Nur Singh, was numbered amonget the victims. * .Outbreaks of cholera are also reported ib 1866, 1868,1872, 18F16,1801, and 1896. In 1898, the disease appeared in the valley in the most virulent form during the months of May and June, and raged in the hills in July and Bngnst. The season was a very dry one, there was little drinking-water to be obtained except from the muddy streams flowing along the river beds, and this source of supply was soon contaminated. 

bny casualties went no doubt imrecorcled, but the reported death8 from cholera in the valley were no leas than 6,063, or 82 per mille of the population as recorded in 1901 ; e terrible death-rate assuredly to be caused by one dieme, end that too in the short space of **two** month 8m.11-got Smell-pox uaed at one time to be vcry common, but the people ere fully dive to the advantag- of vaccination; and in the five years ending with 1902-08,60 per mille of the pqpulation were successfully vaccinated &h year, a proportion which was ..nearly 60 per cent. higher than that recoked for the Pr~vince as a whole. In . . 

1891, when small-pox 'was raging with great virulenw in the valley, the British garriaom enjoyed alm~st oomplete immunity, and the people were not slow to adupon this admirable object-lesson. At the present day the **Nap** 
soon **conry** lain if the vaccinator does' not visit thki di lages with a ceytain regularity. The Kukia, however, regard the subject from a different point of view. **Like** 
Malthus they are afraid that the food supply may not suffice for the ever-increasing number of consumere. It is hard enough, they say, to live as ibis, so why **keq** 
people alive whom God would kill. In the 'chapter on the history of tho State, it has been shown that the Kukis are always willing enough to assist the Deity in his efforts to keep down the population. 

Influenza occasionally causes serious mortality, m- otadirepecially in the hills, and the people suffer a good deal from, dysentery. Conjunctivitis and itch are very common, and venereal disease is said to be fairly prevalent, 
$bough the troops in garrison have been fairly free of recent yews. Measles sometimes causes serious infant mortality. No accurate information is, however, available with regard to the medicd aspects of the *State.* 
Vital statistics are not recorded, **and** there are very few data hm which conclusions can be drawn. This, at **any** 
rate, seems fairly clear, that msn, like most other living thin@, enjoys better health and attains a higber degree of phymcal development than he doee in tho vaUeye of the **Surma** or the Brahmaplitra. There is only one hospital in the State. It contains beds for 12 male **and** 
B fern& potiente, and in **1905,** had a daily average of nearly 9 inmates. The Manipch.is themselvefi do not, however, **seem** ta place much faith in European medmpe, aa the daily **arerage** of out-door patiehts was only **2&-a**
